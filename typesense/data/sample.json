      "RI Health Benefits Exchange Board Meeting Minutes May 15, 2012 1:00pm \u2013 RI Foundation Attendees: Meg Curran (Chair), Don Nokes (Vice-\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090Chair), Linda Katz, Mike Gerhardt, Pam McKnight, Commissioner Koller, Tim Melia, Director Licht, Secretary Costantino, Amy Zimmerman Absent: Dwight McMillan, Marta Martinez",
      "I. Call to Order \u2013 Meg Curran called the meeting to order at 1:00pm. She welcomed members and advised that today we would hear from Angela Sherwin and Dan Meuse with an update on the Gate Review.",
      "II. Rhode Island\u2019s Gate Review: Exchange Program Development & Unified health infrastructure project. Angela Sherwin, Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner and Dan Meuse, Office of the Lt. Governor present with additional comment from Deb Faulkner (Faulkner Consulting Group), Matt Stark (Faulkner Consulting Group) and Tricia Leddy (Department of Health) \u2013 slides available upon request. a. Questions/Comments Clarifications b. Commissioner Koller: Can you speak a bit about development vs.",
      "ongoing resource needs? i. Angela Sherwin: Sure \u2013 there are key technology issues that the policy side needs. Developing the policies and procedures and determining how toe program will operate is different from base needs. What are the exchange resources needed what are the UHIP resources,",
      "c. Director Licht: Human resources, fiscal resources, both? i. Angela Sherwin: Largely human resources in so far as we have already made our request for financial resources. The Caveat is that our financial resource commitment is a cooperative agreement and so as we think through future needs, we can refine that agreement.",
      "ii. Director Licht: The bullet is development vs. ongoing resources, so you have the funds to develop it, but not the money to maintain it.",
      "iii. Angela Sherwin: We have some money to support initial operations for the first year. The key next step for us and a priority for the board s to develop the financial models that we will need to follow in future.",
      "d. Secretary Costantino: When we first started talking about this months ago, there was a discussion of those financial models and what we will need to use to keep it self sustaining. Has their been further modeling or options we can look at and at what point appropriate that we see it.",
      "Angela Sherwin: We have been modeling a variety of revenue options as well as cost options and anticipate that will be something to share soon. \\",
      "i. Dan Meuse: there are a couple of different models that Wakely is tossing around, so what we wanted to do is get as accurate a picture as possible and to do that we have a health insurance survey that we are conducting to have a better idea of how many folks will go into exchange based scenario.",
      "ii. Secretary Costantino: Forgetting the details like that, you could run an example with a number at random, and show from that point on what is the model what is the proposal or options. How do we see what the potential options are or is it to premature for that?",
      "iii. Dan Meuse: I would personally say it is a little premature right now. Our models right now are idea shaped, but haven\u2019t run enough numbers through those models to show this is what we can propose. In the next 6-\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u00908 weeks we should have more of an idea to say this is what we are looking at.",
      "iv. Secretary Costantino: Let\u2019s take MA as an example where they have a fee \u2013 and that may be food for MA, but should there be any deliberation beyond consultants in a row, at some point shouldn\u2019t there be a presentation here to discuss those options and see what the full range is that the consultant are looking at. Feel it would be good to see.",
      "v. Angela Sherwin: We can bring that back for sure. The baseline assumption is that the fee structure like in MA is not feasible as a stand alone given RI\u2019s small size. Thinking about the exchange in this funny position meaning it is not typical state agency nor is it a typical private business, so how can we give it the financial identity between the two.",
      "vi. Director Licht: That is not an unusual concept and had the legislation passed a year ago we would have been a quasi public that could have handled that. I feel what the Sec points out is important because at least in broad-\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090brush strokes, we need to know what the cost of operating an exchange will be, what I means in terms of issuing a fee or something else. This is because it may be, hypothetically, too high if the goal is to have affordable health care, and thus it would lead us to pursue partnering with other states sooner than later.",
      "vii. Jennifer Wood:We will definitely move up in the order of primacy what is the full array of potential financial structures, and what are the models given the size of RI.",
      "viii. Commissioner Koller: I would support that. The other point, resources defined a bunch of different ways, not only dollars but people. I feel there will need to be some sort of monitoring",
      "by this Board around how we are doing with all types of resources.",
      "e. Tim Melia: Was there any discussion about allowing larger employers into the exchange purchase?",
      "i. Deb Faulkner: It did not come up at this time, certainly that door is open for further conversation, but at this most recent Gate Review that is did not come up.",
      "f. Commissioner Koller: We really did not get much input on employee choice options?",
      "i. Deb Faulkner: No we did not. There was an approval of what we are talking about for options to consider and there is a suggestion to get back on the phone with tax attorneys to ensure options are real, but not much guidance. There are a few sates that are thinking a lot about what will work for their employers but for the most part many states have not thought through their employer strategies as far as I can tell.",
      "ii. Dan Meuse: I would say in addition to our federal partners listening to what we say, the feds are also in the process of putting together an exchange for those states who are not doing their own, thus they look to us a little bit trying to go back and forth for ideas and options to think through policy issues and how to claim questions.",
      "g. Mike Gerhardt: But they have to issue regulations, right \u2013 so it is some of a chicken and egg thing, is it not?",
      "i. Deb Faulkner: Yes, and it has been a bit challenging to determine who to best speak to there, a few folks have come forward and been helpful.",
      "h. Tim Melia: Are they waiting for the Supreme Court decision? i. Deb Faulkner: No, do not believe that is the case. ii. Matt Harvey: SHOP is not on the front burner right now for",
      "many states, and indeed for the national plan, working on other points first, i.e. eligibility etc.",
      "i. Secretary Costantino: In terms of the benefit plan, the EHB, and how we handle mandates, what is the time frame for all o this?",
      "i. Deb Faulkner: The EHB process is being handled out of the LT Gove\u2019s office.",
      "ii. Dan Meuse: The decision for what the state choosing for its state benchmark plan must be made by Sept 30; the stakeholder process has started, and we have had two meetings thus far. Our goal would be that by mid august the stakeholder opinions and viewpoints and the analysis we need would be to give us six weeks or so. The feds gave us the deadline of quarter three 2012.",
      "iii. Secretary Costantino: You have a bunch of RI mandates, and at the end of the day some may be a part of the federal mandates, others may not \u2013 then we chose?",
      "iv. Dan Meuse: If we select a small group plan, then they will be built in.",
      "v. Secretary Costantino: Thus every mandate as a part of state law will be a part of our EHB program?",
      "vi. Dan Meuse: It depends on the plan we select. If we chose a small group plan or a state employee plan then we would have state mandates as a part of the EHB package.",
      "vii. Secretary Costantino: What would the option be if there are some mandates do not want in that plan?",
      "viii. Dan Meuse: We could chose as a state a federal plan that does not necessarily cover all the state mandates that are on our books, then the legislature would have to decide to either act to remove those mandates not included from the books, or enact legislation for an alternate means of paying for those.",
      "ix. Secretary Costantino: How does the Sept 30 date align with legislative action?",
      "x. Dan Meuse: Poorly \u2013 this is for plans that begin coverage on and after Jan 1 2014 so there is another leg session between when selected and when they go into effect.",
      "xi. Mike Gerhardt: If I understand correctly then FEHP plans are the only options for a plan that do not include all mandates?",
      "xii. Dan Meuse: Yes, there is an assumption that he benchmark plan choices fail to adequately cover all the ten EHB categories that are laid out \u2013 specifically pediatric vision and habilitative, so the feds say you can augment in those categories.",
      "xiii. Don Nokes: The bill didn\u2019t allow us to put in an EHB that is different than what the state allows \u2013 if we pick a plan that does not cover the mandates in the state, then we need to proceed to the assembly to see if it is acceptable because it has to be inside and outside, yes?",
      "xiv. Dan Meuse: Whether or not a plan has to include them by state law, [\u2026] where there is a state law that say you have to include something that is not something the EHB will include then the state must determine it is paying the mandates not include. The legislature has to determine o we keep them on the books or do we not.",
      "xv. Commissioner Koller: there is a 65 page report that is available on the OHIC and the Healthcare Reform Commission website on this entire topic where you can review these.",
      "j. Director Licht: To make this simpler, how does the basic health plan decision effect what we have just been speaking about?",
      "i. Dan Meuse: the basic health plan is not terribly impacted by the EHB decision. It comes down to less about benefit design and more about programmatic options are as set down by the Feds.",
      "ii. Director Licht: But basic health plan must be adopted by the legislature?",
      "iii. Dan Meuse: Based on current guidance from the feds, yes. k. Commissioner Koller: Which of these four sections in financial",
      "management review did you detect the most nervousness about RI from our federal partners?",
      "i. Deb Faulkner: Nervousness, not a lot. They did not ask questions about exchange accounting, we seem to be leading the conversation about exchange sustainability, premium processing no real concern \u2013 the one place they had real focus on was will states do state based risk adjustment.",
      "ii. Dan Meuse: They kept asking us every chance we got whether RI would be collecting individual premiums or not.",
      "l. Director Licht: You spoke here and before about lots of decisions that must be made \u2013 how do we know which are staff decisions, which are legislative decisions and which will have to be made by the governor with the advice of this Board. It would help to be aware of the categories of decisions and what fall in our purview.",
      "i. Commissioner Koller: The ACA envisions criteria for issuers on the exchange and health plans, they envisioned it in states with no existing regulations. What they do not plan for is that there are states that there are a lot of requirements for states and their requirements. The first block (issuer and health plan criteria) is more alignment than decision-\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090making. The second block (QHP) is what does the exchange want, that is an exchange advisory board governor channel. EHB is much broader than this, and technology is staff AND advisory Board combined.",
      "ii. Deb Faulkner: The Board agenda are the issue of the next nine months that we need your input on.",
      "iii. Director Licht: Right but we need to know when we are making recommendations and when we are not; do think we are in an area where we should know if significant decisions are being made.",
      "iv. Jennifer Wood:We did present to the board a syllabus of topics for the Board which will require the Board to be brought up to spend and given proper analyses so that sufficient work can be done.",
      "m. Mike Gerhardt: The issue then, active purchasing, has to really be defined and fleshed out. What does that imply for plan selection, etc, what does that mean in practical terms to how the exchange is structured?",
      "i. Deb Faulkner: Yes. ii. Jennifer Wood:The value of the gate review from our",
      "perspective was to see if any of the federal authorizers would give a knee jerk reaction and say that we must remove options",
      "from the list. As that was not the case, we can continue to move forward. And today\u2019s review of this material was helpful in that we are going to push the idea of financial sustainability",
      "n. Linda Katz: I just wonder if we also may need to consider that we spend more time with a longer meeting and extended meeting again, but just a thought on that.",
      "i. Amy Zimmerman: As recommendations are being made we catalog them along and people forget the rationale for when and why they were made. That way when you go to have a look back. There is something to line up against.",
      "ii. Director Licht: When we are making a decision, I do not want to be making a decision that precludes a future decision without knowing that. If decisions are interrelated, that should be clear.",
      "o. Commissioner Koller: It might be helpful to understand what the exchange is going to vs. talk about what the entity is going to do \u2013 want to make sure it provide our enrollees the information it is going to need, and other stage that these entities are going to do and the exchange is doing whatever part of its bargaining that it can.",
      "i. Linda Katz: Given that we have adopted principles that say we are doing an integrated system\u2026.",
      "ii. Commissioner Koller: Yes but must be dedicated to eligibility also.",
      "iii. Matt Stark: The fact that we have a technology solution coming down the pike has a solution potentially built in, we are not looking to have an eligibility determination done in some far off place.",
      "p. Mike Gerhardt: Then the idea is that the eligibility determination is that this is in real time?",
      "i. Matt Stark: that is the goal. ii. Linda Katz: CMS and CCIIO are developing a unified application",
      "fort his, working to streamline what we saw on the website. For many people it will not be that complicated. Need to focus on the fact that for many folks it will be a streamlined process. While eligibility is a big piece, recall again what is a staff role and what is our role.",
      "q. Director Licht: Challenge to think about is because of the interconnection with Medicaid and the fact that people may be moving in and out of the exchange (churn) there is a point not anxious to create additional bureaucracy for the exchange, have extensive conversations about what are our options. Can the same person be doing both, and if so, does it align.",
      "r. Commissioner Koller: In presentation we push marketing together with consumer outreach, but we need to be careful on whether an extended marketing piece is needed here.",
      "i. Tricia Leddy: We do have four separate work team, separate from consumer outreach issues, which includes marketing and outreach.",
      "s. Mike Gerhardt: In Massachusetts was it as integrated as you are envisioning here?",
      "i. Tricia Leddy: MA does integrate with Medicaid but it is more that one does one type of service and the other takes care of the other type of service. , one purchases some service from other.",
      "t. Mike Gerhardt: Regarding the proposal timeline, there will be so many outstanding questions on the table due to a lack of federal guidance, so how can vendors respond properly?",
      "i. Dan Meuse: True, but we there are baseline requirements we will need to review and expect vendors to meet.",
      "u. Commissioner Koller: On the UHIP piece, where was the biggest cautionary concern from our federal partners?",
      "i. Dan Meuse: They stated that are concerned about the timelines, where we want to support you in every way possible, every state is dealing with incredibly tight time lines, you are not alone in that and we want to work with you on that.",
      "ii. Matt Harvey: On a relative timeline we are doing well compared to other states, on an absolute timeline we are all doing poorly.",
      "v. Mike Gerhardt: Two quick status questions \u2013 possible reintroduction of the legislation and an update on exchange director",
      "i. Dan Meuse: Legislation has not been introduced and we do not foresee that being put forward this session.",
      "ii. Jennifer Wood: As to the exchange director search, the finalists are with the governor and he expects to make a decision in the next ten days.",

      "Congratulations.",
      "IX Informational Item(s)",
      "a. Adequacy Lawsuit Update",
      "Mr. Robinson: Pawtucket and Woonsocket are suing the State of",
      "Rhode Island over the funding formula. It is our position that the",
      "formula is not constitutional. It does not treat Pawtucket and",
      "Woonsocket children in the same fashion that it treats children from",
      "other districts.",
      "It is the premise of the lawsuit that it should not be an accident of",
      "where you are born in Rhode Island as to what the resources and the",
      "quality of the educational product that children have. We believe that",
      "this lawsuit is the civil rights issue that children have today.",
      "In the early 90\u2019s, then Governor Sundlun at the credit union crisis, cut",
      "back every district in the State of Rhode Island 10%. At that time we",
      "had a very equitable formula called the foundation aid formula that",
      "factored in many issues: property value, income, how many children",
      "are in poverty, how many children are ESL; things of that nature.",
      "Poor districts get more state aid to do just that. By cutting back 10%",
      "on every district, it had a disproportionate effect on every poor",
      "district. Providence, Pawtucket, Woonsocket who get most of their",
      "aid from the state. For East Greenwich and Barrington it was nickels",
      "and dimes, but for Pawtucket, it was a crippling blow.",
      "The School Committee at that time directed me to explore a lawsuit",
      "which would was brought and we had about a three week trial in front",
      "of Judge Needham. We were successful in front of Judge Needham.",
      "He ruled in our favor. But in 1995, the Supreme Court overturned that",
      "decision.",
      "Because of the lawsuit, they did away with the formula. But the",
      "legislature did pump more money into the poorer districts even",
      "though there was no formula. One of the things they used is student",
      "population but they have a \u201chold harmless provision.\u201d They didn\u2019t",
      "take into effect demographics. Some districts were getting richer and",
      "some were getting poorer.",
      "In 1997 the student incentive initiative act acknowledges that the local",
      "cities and towns rely on the local property tax. Certain communities",
      "because of low tax capacity in a high tax effort are unable to",
      "appropriate to support funds for core instructional programs. The",
      "General Assembly also recognizes the need to reduce inequities in",
      "resource distribution in cities and towns as well as among the state\u2019s",
      "cities and schools.",
      "In 2004 this is what they pledged. All children should have access to",
      "an adequate and meaningful education regardless of their residence",
      "or economic means. A school funding system should treat school",
      "tax payers equitably; limit the portions of school funding by property",
      "taxes and establish sufficient cost control on school spending.",
      "The intent of this chapter is to promote a school spending system in",
      "Rhode Island predicated on student need and taxpayer ability to pay.",
      "A new school funding system in the state should promote",
      "educational equity for all students and reduce reliance on the",
      "property tax.",
      "A state education funding formula with a student population needs",
      "driven. In 2004 they said, students eligible for free and reduced",
      "lunch, those participating in language assistance programs and",
      "special education. What they were saying legislatively is these",
      "certain factors we have to consider in a formula.",
      "For a long time we were one of only two states that did not have a",
      "funding formula. When Pennsylvania passed one, we were the only",
      "state that did not have one.",
      "It\u2019s important to note that throughout the country, legislatures have",
      "wrestled with what is the cost to get an adequate education to",
      "children? They have commissioned experts who come in and do",
      "adequacy studies. They come up with what an average annual cost",
      "would be per pupil to provide an adequate education. Rhode Island",
      "went out to bid and hired a firm from Colorado and that is the Wood",
      "Report. This report determined in 2006 it would cost $9,500-$10,000",
      "per child, per year.",
      "The General Assembly also set up a technical advisory group to",
      "review this report and to develop a funding formula. That group said",
      "$10,607 per pupil for 2008-2009. That was the recommendation and",
      "there was no action taken.",
      "Representative Edith Ajello from Providence said let\u2019s look at the",
      "$600M for education in the state budget and recommended $10,600",
      "per pupil. Had they taken that money and divided it equally that would",
      "have given Pawtucket $12M. That bill was submitted and no action",
      "was taken.",
      "In February, 2010, we filed the present action. Shortly after filing it,",
      "the legislature debated and enacted the present funding formula. In",
      "2006, they said you needed $10,600 per year. The new formula",
      "enacted in 2010 says you need $8,333 per student. How does it",
      "become 25% less expensive to educate a student in two more years?",

      "Present: Present: Chair Lucien Benoit, Dean Naylor, Gene Simone,",
      "Alex Biliouris, Mali Jones, Gene Currie. Absent: Art Bassett. Also",
      "present were Town Planner Bob Ericson and Town Solicitor Rick",
      "Nadeau.",

      "Mr. Currie made a motion to approve the minutes of April 19, 2012, as",
      "corrected. Ms. Jones seconded the motion, with all in favor.",

      "Location: 925 Victory Highway, Assessor\u2019s Plat 1, Lot 108, Zoning:",
      "BN (Neighborhood Business)",
      "The Chair stated that Ms. Jones would be voting on this application,",
      "along with the four full members of the Board present at the meeting.",
      "Mr. Ericson informed the Board that the applicant had met with the",
      "neighbors and submitted revised plans with no entry/exit on",
      "Homecrest Avenue, which is a major improvement that also reduces",
      "impervious cover. He suggested that the Board members ask how the",
      "applicant plans to fully buffer the sight line between the commercial",
      "parking and residential zone, at least to the southernmost residential",
      "property line opposite the Navigant site.",
      "Attorney John Shekarchi was present for the applicant. He introduced",
      "traffic engineer Robert Clinton of VHB, who presented his credentials",
      "and a summary of the traffic impact study. He stated that the study",
      "had been conducted during peak periods of traffic for the credit union",
      "and for businesses along the adjacent roadway. He also included",
      "proposed development and future potential growth. The study",
      "included safety aspects, wait times, and sight distances. He stated",
      "that as a business, a credit union is not a big traffic generator, and",
      "that most traffic will be pass-by trips. He also used counts from the",
      "Smithfield Navigant site (Route 44 location) in his analysis. His",
      "conclusion is that the amount of traffic generated will not impact the",
      "levels of service currently existing on Route 102. He added that the",
      "traffic study used the most conservative numbers, and that calculated",
      "levels of service and calculated delays are often higher than what",
      "actually occurs in the field.",
      "Mr. Naylor asked about the traffic patterns within the site and whether",
      "significant queuing will occur at the drive-thru lanes. Mr. Clinton",
      "stated that at the Route 44 site, there was a maximum of two vehicles",
      "in any lane (three total lanes), but that there were never six total",
      "vehicles (never two vehicles in each lane at any one time). He does",
      "not anticipate queuing problems within the site. He added that the",
      "layout is good for exiting the site, with the length of the exit lane",
      "giving adequate room to accommodate traffic within the site, as well",
      "as traffic exiting the site.",
      "Mr. Biliouris asked if there would be a stop sign at the exit. Mr.",
      "Clinton stated that typically the RIDOT does not like stop signs in",
      "driveways. This application will go to RIDOT during the physical",
      "alteration permitting process, so if a sign is necessary, they will",
      "decide during that time.",
      "In response to the Chair\u2019s questions, Mr. Clinton stated that sight",
      "distances were more than adequate. Mr. Naylor asked whether",
      "making no right turns on red at the traffic light at Brigido\u2019s would",
      "have any impact on the traffic. Mr. Clinton stated that he didn\u2019t think it",
      "would be necessary, given the distance and the number of curb cuts",
      "between the Navigant site and that intersection.",
      "Navigant Facilities Manager James Drake stated that the credit union",
      "would reach full service level about three years after opening. Mr.",
      "Biliouris asked about the location of the ATM at the back of the",
      "building and related safety issues. Mr. Drake stated that the location",
      "in the rear of the building is standard and gives better flow through",
      "the site. He added that most towns mandate the back location. He",
      "also stated that he is comfortable with the level of security available.",
      "Ms. Jones also asked about the security of the drive-thru ATM and",
      "asked if there is a panic button available. Mr. Drake stated that there",
      "is a certain radius of foot candles for lighting, CCTV that is recorded",
      "for months, as well as many alarms. He said there is no panic button,",
      "and while it probably can be added, it may become a nuisance to the",
      "police department.",
      "The Chair asked when construction would begin and when the credit",
      "union would open. Mr. Drake stated that construction would take",
      "approximately eight months, and they would like to start next fall. If",
      "they don\u2019t start in the fall, they would begin construction in the",
      "following spring. Mr. Simone asked about signage. Mr. Drake stated",
      "that it would be located above the door and there will probably be a",
      "pylon sign. This will be detailed at Preliminary Plan stage.",
      "Mr. Ericson stated that with commercial parking abutting residential",
      "properties, opaque screening is required. He said the existing",
      "screening is insufficient. He would like to see a natural barrier. Mr.",
      "Shekarchi stated that the applicant will note that and make",
      "appropriate changes.",
      "The Chair opened the hearing to the public at 7:35 pm.",
      "Ray Sylvestre, an abutting property owner on Homecrest Avenue,",
      "addressed the Board. He stated that he and some neighbors have met",
      "with the applicant since the previous meeting. He stated that he",
      "commends Navigant on their willingness to work with the abutting",
      "property owners. He stated that he still has strong concerns with the",
      "added traffic and the safety issues for the people living on Homecrest",
      "Ave. He said he disagrees with Navigant's analysis that there will be",
      "no additional traffic with the opening of their business. He stated that",
      "he is not against the development, but he does not want it to happen",
      "at the risk of the residents' safety and security. He said that he would",
      "like to have the street turned into a cul-de-sac, instead of a through",
      "street, but he would also ask the Town Council to approve adding",
      "speed bumps to the road to deter drivers from using Homecrest Ave.",
      "as a cut through street. He added that the traffic is more than a",
      "nuisance; it is a hazard. The Chair suggested lowering the posted",
      "speed on the road, but Mr. Sylvestre stated that they drivers don't pay",
      "attention to the speed limit.",
      "The Chair stated that with new development, the Planning Board",
      "would have more to say about the construction of streets, but since",
      "this is an existing road, the Town Council needs to decide. Mr.",
      "Ericson said he would have the DPW director discuss options with",
      "the Town Council. He said another option is to lower the perceived",
      "design speed by planting bushes along the road that appear to",
      "constrict the roadway. Mr. Sylvestre asked if it would be acceptable to",
      "have neighbors sign a petition to present to the Town Council. Mr.",
      "Ericson stated that it would be a good idea.",
      "Colleen Bogan, who has lived on Homecrest Ave. for seven years,",
      "also addressed the Board. She stated that she is also very concerned",
      "with traffic and the safety of the children and residents of the",
      "neighborhood. She gave some examples of cars speeding through",
      "the neighborhood and stated that the situation has been dangerous",
      "with Dunkin' Donuts traffic and that it will only be worsened by the",
      "additional business. The Chair stated that enforcement issues are",
      "handled by the police, but that the concerns can be brought to the",
      "Town Council.",
      "Mr. Ericson stated that another public hearing will be held at the time",
      "of Preliminary Plan review, in approximately 3-4 months. Mr. Naylor",
      "made a motion to close the public hearing at 7:55 pm. Mr. Simone",
      "seconded the motion, with all in favor.",
      "Mr. Biliouris made a motion that the Planning Board approve the",
      "Major Land Development Master Plan revised to April 30, 2012 for the",
      "Navigant Credit Union branch at 925 Victory Hwy, Plat 1, Lot 108 with",
      "one condition: that the opaque screening between the commercial",
      "parking and residential zone meet all zoning requirements. Ms. Jones",
      "seconded the motion. Planning Board vote was as follows: YES: Mr.",
      "Benoit, Mr. Biliouris, Mr. Naylor, Mr. Simone, Ms. Jones.",
      "4. Review of proposed zoning ordinance amendment to Section 6.19,",
      "Regulation of groundwater aquifer zones, groundwater recharge",
      "areas, wellhead protection areas and water supply basin with",
      "possible votes or other actions on consistency with the",
      "Comprehensive Plan and other recommendations to the Town",
      "Council.",
      "Caroly Shumway, representing the ODC, was present with new",
      "impervious cover updates from Lorraine Joubert of the URI NEMO",
      "program. The Board reviewed the tables in the report. Mr. Ericson",
      "asked the Board to review the ordinance for consistency with the",
      "Comprehensive Plan. The URI tables considered all options and",
      "buildouts for the aquifer zones. One major issue is that the town",
      "needs to ensure the viability of commercial/industrial zones. He",
      "stated that the town is looking for low impervious cover overall in the",
      "aquifer protection area, but not at the expense of commercial and",
      "industrial development. He suggested one option of recommending",
      "40% impervious limits for commercial and industrial zones, with",
      "redevelopment up to existing impervious cover for pre-existing",
      "non-conforming lots. The present Zoning Ordinance, Section 6.19.9,",
      "considers only lot size, allowing 40% impervious cover for lots under",
      "200,000 square feet and 30% for lots over 200,000 square feet.",
      "Ms. Shumway explained three different scenarios generated by the",
      "report. She stated that a goal of 35% impervious is not onerous, since",
      "the townwide analysis shows that current BH districts are at 34.5%.",
      "She also said it could be written in as a goal of 35-40%, which gives",
      "the option for a variance. Mr. Biliouris expressed concerns with",
      "existing situations in which development would not be possible,",
      "since the percentage of impervious is already greater than 35%. He",
      "gave an example of a 100,000 square ft. lot. If there is a 20,000 square",
      "ft. building, with 20,000 square ft. of parking area, then the property is",
      "already at 40% impervious. He also suggested trying to create an",
      "ordinance that will work in conjunction with improved technology.",
      "With technology improving water quality, it may not be necessary to",
      "limit the impervious area. Ms. Shumway stated that the town should",
      "be encouraging best management practices, and for the sake of",
      "writing an ordinance a number is needed. Since the actual BH",
      "districts in town are less than 35% impervious, the 35% goal should",
      "be workable.",
      "The Chair stated that the Board can vote on the ordinance's",
      "consistency with the Comp Plan, but that more discussion is needed",
      "and that the Board would like to submit recommendations along with",
      "the ordinance to the Town Council. Mr. Ericson said there is time to",
      "do this since it likely won't go to public hearing until September.",
      "Mr. Naylor made a motion that the Planning Board finds the proposed",
      "amendments to Section 6.19 to be consistent with the North",
      "Smithfield Comprehensive Plan, including the Groundwater Aquifer",
      "Protection Overlay District zoning map in support of it. Ms. Jones",
      "seconded the motion. Mr. Biliouris stated that the Planning Board",
      "had further comments on the ordinance. Mr. Ericson stated that",
      "separate recommendations can be submitted. The Chair stated that",
      "members have expressed concerns and that further",
      "recommendations will be forthcoming. Mr. Ericson stated that he",
      "would pass that along with the motion. Planning Board vote was as",
      "follows: YES: Chair Lucien Benoit, Dean Naylor, Alex Biliouris, Gene",
      "Simone, Mali Jones.",
      "5. Review of proposed zoning ordinance amendment to Section",
      "6.13-6.15, Parking and Loading, with possible votes on",
      "recommendations to the Town Council.",
      "Mr. Ericson reviewed a few proposed changes to the Parking and",
      "Loading sections of the Zoning Ordinance. He stated that he would",
      "submit a clean copy with highlighted changes, as well as a list of all",
      "the proposed changes, to the Board for the next meeting. At that time,",
      "the Board can move to send the proposed changes to the Town",
      "Council.",

      "Improvement Plan:",
      "Review and recommendations to the Budget Committee and Town",
      "Council.",
      "The Chair stated that the Board is still anticipating a submission from",
      "the School Department. Mr. Ericson stated that the School Committee",
      "stated that they will prepare a synopsis of the Halliwell School study",
      "that had been commissioned 6 years ago and present it to the Board.",
      "The Chair stated that the Board would like to see the full report.",
      "7. Cherry Brook sub-watershed: Review and approval of letter to",
      "Town Council regarding stormwater management options.",
      "Mr. Ericson drafted a letter to the Town Council, as requested at a",
      "previous Planning Board meeting, and submitted the draft to the",
      "Board. Ms. Jones made a motion to send the letter to the Town",
      "Council. Mr. Naylor seconded the motion, with all in favor.",
      "8. Planning update: Review of current events",
      "Items discussed were the resignation of the RI EDC Chair, the Dry",
      "Lands bill before the state legislature, savings of $29,500 from the",
      "Johnson Controls energy project, the manufacturing facility at High",
      "Rocks, and possible tenants for Dowling Village.",
      "The Chair also asked about activity on the property next to the RV",
      "dealership on Quaker Highway. Mr. Ericson stated that he has heard",
      "they were going to condo the site. The Chair also asked if there was",
      "any current talk about a storage facility on the site of Extreme",
      "Restoration.",
      "The Chair also asked about the process for rezoning the area from",
      "Park Square to the Lincoln line along 146A, as well as the area along",
      "102 from Cumberland Farms to the Jehovah's Witness site. Mr.",

      "WHEREAS, on December 28, 2007, the Rhode Island Airport",
      "Corporation (RIAC) and Northstar Aviation Inc. (Northstar) entered",
      "into a Full Service Fixed Base Aircraft Operator Agreement",
      "(Agreement); and",

      "WHEREAS, On July 7, 2011, the Board approved the terms of a",

      "potential opportunities that would render the full investment",
      "expenditure as unnecessary. RIAC staff believes that the new",
      "investment amount is sufficient to justify a new Second Amendment",
      "on the terms set forth below; and",
      "WHEREAS, RIAC staff recommends that the following terms be",
      "incorporated into the Second Amendment to the Agreement:",
      "Lease Term: Section 2 of the Agreement shall be amended to reflect a",
      "term of 30 years and an Expiration Date of December 31, 2037.",

      "current monthly rent will be reflected as $19,408.43. This amount will",

      "Agreement with the exception that the total monthly rent beginning in",
      "January 2018 will be reduced by $2,463.56 which represents the",
      "amount allocable to building rent prior to the second Amendment.",
      "Investment: Northstar shall demolish the existing facility and",
      "construct the New Facility on the site. The minimum investment in",
      "the new facility will be $5 million. The amendment will clearly state",
      "that RIAC shall have the right to review and approve all design and",
      "construction activities. Physical construction of the New Facility",
      "shall commence within one year of the execution of the Second",

      "Utilities, Taxes and Maintenance Expenses: All utility, tax and",
      "maintenance expenses related to the Premises (including the New",
      "Facility) will remain the responsibility of Northstar. The Amendment",
      "will incorporate certain maintenance and improvement standards",
      "related to the New Facility and related improvements. Based to the",
      "length of the potential new term and based on an analysis of the",
      "useful life of the fuel storage tanks, the Amendment will reflect that",
      "Northstar shall be solely responsible for any required fuel storage",
      "tank modifications or upgrades. The current fuel storage capacity",
      "shall not increase during the term of the Amendment.",
      "Approvals: Northstar, at its sole cost, is responsible for applying for",

      "performance, and lien bonds in an amount necessary to complete",
      "construction of the New Facility and related improvements.",
      "Ownership of the New Facility and Related Improvements: On the last",
      "day of the Term, or if earlier terminated, the New Facility and related",
      "improvements shall automatically, without the necessity of any",
      "further action on the part of RIAC or Northstar, become the property",
      "of RIAC, and Northstar will assign, transfer, and convey the New",
      "Facility and related improvements to RIAC as of the last day of the",
      "Lease Term, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, and equities of",
      "third parties claiming by, through or under Lessee.",

      "and/or approve customer service standards of Northstar.",
      "Insurance Requirements: Consistent with the terms of the existing",
      "Agreement. Northstar shall continue to maintain all insurance and",

      "Members Present: Cindy Kaplan Dan O'Mahony Stephen Palmer Judy Ryan Joseph Schall Vince Wicker Laura Young Presiding: Cindy Kaplan until 7:15 p.m.; Vince Wicker beginning at 7:15 p.m. Also Present: Debbie Barchi, Director Meeting brought to order at 7:09 p.m. Minutes from the March 15, 2012 meeting were approved (motion by Ryan; second by Palmer). There was no April meeting. Financial Reports: Accepted. Expenditures are being tracked closely at this point in the fiscal year. Statistical Reports: Accepted. Print circulation statistics are down compared to last year (consistent with a statewide trend) partly as a result of the increase in use of ebooks. It is important for the library to continue to explore new and alternative ways to continue to serve the community (e.g., programs, web site, etc.). Q: Is there a concern in the state re: the closing of some of the town libraries? A: This is a big concern; both the direct loss of services to patrons as well as the extended impact on other libraries (e.g., increase of use from neighboring residents, increase in dues in OSL). Q: Has there been a decrease in demand for reference/research services? A: Many people believe everything is on the Internet; people have many alternative sources for information these days via the web. The library and reference librarians can provide enhanced services and more than what is available via the free web. The library needs to keep current by providing information services in ways that are useful to patrons; e..g., via mobile devices, providing relevant apps for users. Vince Wicker mentioned that he accesses the library\u2019s databases via his iPhone. The library is providing \u201cDid you know\u2026\u201d tips in its monthly library newsletter. Director\u2019s Report: Director reminded the Board that the Town Financial Meeting will be Wednesday, May 23beginning at 7 p.m. at Barrington High School.",
      "The Town is sponsoring a volunteer appreciation cook-out in honor of all municipal volunteers (Wednesday, June 6 beginning at 5:30 p.m. at Barrington High School). All members of the Trustees Board and the Friends of the Library Board are invited. The library submitted a Champlin grant application before the April 30 deadline requesting funding for outdoor surveillance cameras. The cameras would be motion-detection driven (as recommended by the police chief). Also a separate request was made for a new self-checkout machine and 3M security gate. Old business: None New business:",

      "a. Status of Bookkeeper Position \u2013 an ad was posted in the Barrington Times; 14 applications were received to date. Debbie will conduct interviews; hope to have a decision by the end of May. (In interviews, we might want to inquire whether applicants have experience setting up or dealing with restricted versus non-restricted funds.) The IRS-990 extension form was filed by the accountant. In the past they have done this pro bono; this year they will charge us $1,500 (reduced rate, but not pro bono).",
      "b. Fundraising \u2013 any fundraising committee should be led by someone on the Board but can include other (outside) members; should include someone from the Friends board. FOL has roughly 400 members. The Board will need to decide whether we are raising money to add to endowment versus capital improvement; determine the vision/goals for what we want to accomplish. There was a question about how much we must raise and spend each year in order to maintain tax-exempt status. $2.5M is the rough estimate to renovate the second floor of the library.",
      "Absent a decision about a new senior center, there will be no additional space within the Peck Center; only a redesign of the existing space. Possible goals include:",
      "\u2022 Redesign of the children\u2019s area \u2022 Better use of the auditorium/gallery spaces so that multiple programs could take",
      "place independently \u2022 Refresh the rest of the second floor",
      "For first floor renovation, the Town contributed $900K of $1.3M project (state reimbursed Town for $700K from library grants program; net cost to Town was $200K). A detailed review of the last capital project (2005 first floor renovation) will be an important step for early planning/discovery. Funding sources for the 2005 first floor renovation were: Library Corporation; Champlin Foundation; FOL; Town; bequest ($300K) We should check the municipal rules re: opportunities for naming areas. One possible funding source is $200K endowment (restricted for use on children\u2019s materials with an animal theme).",
      "New Business:",
      "a. Discussion with Coastline Investment \u2013 George Burwell from Coastline Trust Company presented an Investment Review (as of April 30, 2012). The account\u2019s asset allocations are at or very close to target percentages. Q: What is Coastline\u2019s position re: international allocation in light of recent events? A: Market timing is difficult and often not productive; we tend to sustain over time rather than react to immediate events; would track over time and respond accordingly. Much of the European situation has already been anticipated by investors and banks; would not recommend abandoning international markets. Q: Is Coastline still comfortable with the percentage of our portfolio in international investments? A: Yes, especially emerging markets (includes China); this is where much of the growth will be. This account is well protected by the diversity of investment funds. Q: What is Coastline\u2019s opinion of our overall asset allocation? A: Current allocation reflects a solid conservative position. Muddled economic situation hasn\u2019t changed significantly since when funds were originally allocated. We are assuming high-single-digit annual returns for stocks and low bond yields for the foreseeable future. Other financial management consultants share this view (the \u201cnew normal\u201d). Original allocations were based on the need to spend/withdraw money (3-5%). If spend rate is low, you could boost up equity holdings. Library does not anticipate the need to spend a large amount of money in the next 3 years. Policy has flexibility built in (+/- 10%). Mr. Burwell would like direction from the Board if we wanted any changes. More stocks run more risk. If do not anticipate spending much money, we could go higher in stocks, but recommended not more than 60% in stocks (currently 50-50). Account balance was $450K when Coastline took the account (30 months ago); now $561K.",
      "Coastline can run specific reports as needed. George Burwell makes presentations before the Board every six months.",

During the discussion, it was suggested that perhaps a retreat could scheduled to build strategy. Upon a motion made by Daniel Baudouin and seconded by Councilwoman Sabina Matos, it was voted to schedule a board retreat, to be coordinated with the mayor\u2019s schedule. Legal counsel suggested that a facilitator be utilized to conduct the retreat. Motion passed by unanimous vote. Mr. MacDonald proceeded to present the remaining agenda items under the Report of the Executive Director. Mr. MacDonald began by discussing meetings that Mr. Bennett and he have had with RIEDC. There have been discussions regarding RIEDC taking over the PEPD loan funds with PEDP remaining responsible for those funds, which was not accepted. PEDP will be entering into a partnership with RIEDC for the underwriting of a portion ($2 million) of our new loan funds; however the loans will remain PEDP loans. PEDP will be parceling out the loan prospecting. The loan files have been revamped, which HUD has approved. Current business is a prospective loan in the amount of $950,000.00, which was not a good fit with our program. Mr. Bennett briefly reviewed the loan to the Narragansett Creamery, which recently closed its loan. A brief discussion followed with regard to loan prospecting. Staff has been meeting with area banks so that all are aware of the PEDP programs and what we do. Mr. MacDonald concluded by discussing the loan underwriting. A contract underwriter has been hired who was formerly with Citizens Bank, Thomas Hoagland. Mr. Hoagland will also bring in loan business for PEDP. NEW BUSINESS The first agenda item under New Business entertained by the Board of Directors was the presentation of loans for write-off. Mr. MacDonald presented this agenda item. The last portfolio-wide write-off was in 2008. There has been pressure from HUD to do regular write-offs and to create a write-off policy. PEDP will still continue attempts to collect on the loans that will be written-off, when possible. A suggestion was made that a sub-committee of the board be formed to meet with staff to review the loans ready for write-off and then bring this agenda item back to the board for approval. The committee to work with Mr. MacDonald relative to the loans for write-off was formed and will consist of the following board members: Joseph Caffey, Daniel Baudouin and Gerald Massa. The sub-committee meeting will also be attended by Joshua Teverow, PEDP legal counsel for loan collections. The next agenda item entertained by the Board of Directors was the presentation of the Loan Committee Action Reports from its April and May 2012 meetings. Kathy Cosentino presented this agenda item. A brief overview of each request and action was provided. Upon a motion made by Daniel Baudouin and seconded by Janet Raymond, it was voted to accept the Loan Committee Action Report from the April 12, 2012 meeting. Requests at this meeting were considered from: Delta Auto Body (Delta Enterprise, Inc.); Pisaturo Real Estate, LLC (Irving) (2 requests); Salon Bianco; and Armory Revival Company. Kas DeCarvalho recused from voting in connection with the request of Salon Bianco. Motion passed by vote. Upon a motion made by Janet Raymond and seconded by Kas DeCarvalho, it was voted to accept the Loan Committee actions from its May 10, 2012 meeting in connection with the following requests: Delta Auto Body (Delta Enterprise, Inc.); Dr. Dennis Karambelas & Associates, Inc.; EpiVax, Inc.; and AV Studio LLC. Motion passed by vote. Upon a motion made by Janet Raymond and seconded by Gerald Massa, it was voted to accept the Loan Committee actions from its May 10, 2012, in connection with the following requests: Van Leesten Group, LLC and Olneyville Housing Corporation. Joseph Caffey and Kas DeCarvalho recused from voting in connection with the request of The Van Leesten Group. Joseph Caffey, Councilwoman Sabina Matos and Clay Rockefeller recused from voting in connection with the request of Olneyville Housing Corporation. Motion passed by vote.",
      "PEDP Board of Directors Meeting Minutes May 16, 2012 Page 3 of 3 The next agenda item entertained by the Board of Directors was the request for ratification of staff approval of continued interest-only payments for a period of two (2) years by the original Bannister House, which will be assuming the PEDP loan after emerging from Receivership. Thereafter, principal and interest payments will be based on a 30-year amortization with a 10-year balloon. Mr. MacDonald presented this agenda item. Upon a motion made by Kas DeCarvalho and seconded by Daniel Baudouin, it was voted to ratify staff approval of continued interest-only payments for a period of two (2) years upon the exit from Receivership in connection with the loan to Bannister House. Motion passed by unanimous vote. The next agenda item entertained by the Board of Directors was the re-presentation of the request for subordination in connection with the loan to New City Conrad, LLC f/k/a The Conrad. Kathy Cosentino indicated that this request has since been withdrawn. No action was required in connection with this agenda item. OTHER BUSINESS/PUBLIC COMMENT Mr. Bennett and Mr. MacDonald answered questions of the members with regard to a budget for PEDP for the next fiscal year and the fire approval process. Mr. Bennett updated the members on projects currently in the works or underway in the city. Mr. Caffey requested that a certificate of appreciation for Thomas Deller be prepared for the mayor\u2019s signature and sent on behalf of the PEDP Board of Directors. Mr. Bennett questioned if the noon meeting time is acceptable for the members. It was agreed that the noon meeting time is convenient for the members, however there was a request to move the day that the meetings take place due to a member having a conflict with another meeting that takes place at the same time. The members will be polled for a new meeting date to see if any other conflicts may exist relative to moving the meeting date. Upon a motion made by Daniel Baudouin and seconded by Janet Raymond, the meeting was adjourned at 1:32 PM.",

      "_____________________",
      "Pursuant to proper notice, the regular meeting of the Board of",
      "Directors of the Bristol County Water Authority was called to order by",
      "Chairman Jannitto at 5:15 pm, 450 Child Street, Warren Office,",
      "Warren, Rhode Island. Executive Director Pamela Marchand and the",
      "following Directors were in attendance at the commencement of the",
      "meeting:",
      "Robert Allio, Paul Bishop, Joseph DeMelo, Kevin Fitta, William",
      "Gosselin, John Jannitto, Raymond Palmieri, Frank Sylvia",
      "Director absent \u2013 Allan Klepper",
      "The directors were given two resolutions for their consideration:",
      "1. Resolution to current refund $12,195,000 General Revenue Bonds,",
      "1997 Series A and $6,090,000 General Revenue Bonds, 1998 Series A",
      "and issue up to $7,300,000 General Revenue Refunding bonds",
      "2. Resolution to borrow up to $500,000 and issue $500,000 General",
      "Revenue Bonds Series 2012A to fund Franklin Street project, SCADA",
      "system, system improvements, debt service reserve fund and costs",
      "of issuance",
      "Executive Director P. Marchand stated that there were 2 resolutions",
      "to be discussed tonight. One is to refinance BCWA series of bonds",
      "originally issued for the East Bay Pipeline and the second is to",
      "borrow $500,000 to do system work.",
      "Manager of Accounting and MIS, Mr. Mark Champagne made a",
      "presentation to the Board.",
      "Mr. Champagne explained the flow of cash to BCWA and how funds",
      "move through all the funds established under the bond documents.",
      "All monies from customers are deposited in the Revenue Fund.",
      "Transfers from the Revenue Fund are done at month end to the Debt",
      "Service Fund, O & M Account, O&M Reserve. Mr. Champagne",
      "explained how the Debt Service Coverage Ratio is computed. The",
      "minimum requirement for this ratio is 1.25%, computed annually and",
      "reported to the Trustee. He noted that it is monitored on a regular",
      "basis, and the Authority is attempting to increase the coverage to",
      "meet best practices.",
      "Mr. Champagne explained to the Board the projected savings with a",
      "lower interest rate by refinancing of the 1997 and 1998 Bonds and the",
      "additional debt service created by borrowing $1.4 million. Without a",
      "rate increase in effect, the Authority is not able to borrow the full $1.4",
      "million and meet the financial covenants required by the bond",
      "documents. Mr. Champagne noted that the amount to be borrowed",
      "has been scaled back to $500,000 which the Authority can",
      "accomplish and meet the bond covenants. He noted that the",
      "Authority is not changing the maturity dates of the 1997 and 1998",
      "Bonds,",
      "Director Palmieri asked about additional costs associated with",
      "refinancing.",
      "Ms. Mack explained the different fees associated with refinancing,",
      "which is dependent upon the type of sale. Categories of the fees are",
      "\u2013 underwriter\u2019s fee, rating agency fee, electronic fee for printing the",
      "OS, trustee fee, trustee counsel fee, bond counsel fee, bank fee, bank",
      "counsel fee, and financial advisor fee. Also an independent",
      "consultant or an independent engineering firm or accounting firm will",
      "have to give a certification that the Authority will meet the financial",
      "covenants in the bond documents before the Bonds can be sold,",
      "which is an additional cost. She noted that all of these fees are taken",
      "into account and any savings projected are after the costs of",
      "issuance are paid. Based on current rates, the financial advisor was",
      "projecting approximately 6% savings. While rates do fluctuate, the",
      "advisors to the Authority would not recommend the refinancing",
      "unless there was at least a 3% savings, unless there were other",
      "reasons involved.",
      "Mr. Champagne explained that there is no control on revenue",
      "collected by BCWA. BCWA is dependent on water usage by",
      "customers. The Authority can only control expenses, which BCWA",
      "did last year by saving money on insurance, reduction of personnel",
      "from 34 employees to 29 employees, and selling excess property",
      "such as the 2 cars. BCWA is trying to economize to control expenses",
      "to meet falling demand, and reduced revenues.",
      "Executive Director P. Marchand stated that BCWA had been operating",
      "at bare minimum for the last several years. She advised that BCWA",
      "cannot continue to operate that way. She noted that there is work",
      "that has to be done, and the Executive Director is developing a five",
      "year and 20 year capital program to identify such work and how the",
      "Authority will fund the capital improvements by developing an",
      "infrastructure fund which will help with the debt service ratio.",
      "Director Sylvia made the following motion",
      "MOTION: To adopt the resolution to current refund $12,195,000",
      "General Revenue Bonds, 1997 Series A and $6,090,000 General",

      "service reserve fund and costs of issuance.",
      "Director Gosselin seconded the motion.",
      "Director Allio asked if $500,000 would sufficient to pay for all the",
      "necessary projects.",
      "Executive Director Marchand stated that it would not pay for",
      "everything. Projects to be completed with this money are Franklin",
      "Street and Barrington Pump Station. If money is still available then",
      "we will install controls for SCADA. The resolution is all inclusive to",
      "use the funds for the distribution system.",
      "Executive Director Marchand stated that BCWA will be using $260,000",
      "left over from the Hope Street Project for the Franklin Street project,",
      "which is expected to cost $400,000.",
      "Motion passed unanimously.",

      "For the record, Walter Edge from Bacon and Edge Consulting was present. NEW BUSINESS: 1. Discussion/Vote to Adopt the FY 2013 School Budget \u2013 1st Passage \u2013 A. McGuire-Forcier, G. Donoyan The meeting started with the capital budget line item. G. Donoyan advised the Committee that P. Fontaine has submitted a memo to the Committee regarding the line items they requested information on for the budget. G. Donoyan said there are three custodians that are listed in the Bernon Shop and the school they are assigned to. G. Donoyan\u2019s recommendation is to remove them from the Bernon Shop because they are assigned to a school. W. Edge said if P. Fontaine has all his staff accounted for then remove that line item. G. Donoyan said she relies on what P. Fontaine has said. A. McGuire-Forcier suggested telling P. Fontaine that we removed that line item but he might want to just double check and, if need, be we could put back in. Therefore, on page 2, regular salaries - custodians for $34,632 was removed. On page 4, equipment rental McFee, is for copiers, we will keep that line item. Next one down is equipment/vehicle rental, which is the postage meter lease, keep this line item. On page 5, maintenance and repairs for $21,935 - C. Roberts said he thinks the Committee gave him some vehicle maintenance money during the meeting on Saturday under another vehicle maintenance account. G. Donoyan said that the expenses that we were actually allotted under the UCOA may have been a vehicle expense charged to one UCOA and maybe to another one as well. G. Donoyan said if something has been expended and has been corroborated with Dina and W. Edge, she think it is important to keep it in. Committee agrees. Next line item is other purchased property; remove because it was a one time deal to have the roofs shoveled. Next is maintenance supplies/parts for $3213, not sure what this is. A. McGuire-Forcier asked C. Roberts if he wants us to start pulling invoices. G. Donoyan said it is very wise to say that any expense over $2000 comes before the School Committee. So, given the fact that Braver and Company has come in, Dina has submitted a thorough review of this information, and if we start looking through invoices it will hold up looking through this budget. C. Roberts said he is not asking to see invoices; he just doesn\u2019t want us to think that just because something was spent doesn\u2019t mean that it will be spent again. C. Roberts prepared and provided the Committee with data on copier expenses. He stated that he has an issue with what we spend on copies and also thinks $195,000 is too much money and thinks we need to re-adjust the copiers. W. Edge said there was a major increase of copiers when we built the new middle schools. We went from 6 to 14 machines. G. Donoyan said we used the copiers a lot because we do not have consumables for textbooks and the teachers are making copies from workbooks for the students. To say that we do not need these machines is not in the best interest for education. W. Edge advised the committee where these copiers are located. He also said that they purchased extra copiers because they under spent on the buildings and they had extra money. However, they did not realize that 14 service contracts were going to cost a lot of money. C. Roberts said that Dina gave him a projection of $206,000 and he is actually short $7000 according to her projections. He does feel that this line item does need to be scaled back. G. Donoyan said we might be able to reduce the cost of the lease but that is something a finance director would have to look at. C. Roberts suggests to budget this line item at $150,000. A. McGuire-Forcier asked W. Edge to look into this line item and give the committee a suggestion on what could be an acceptable budget amount. W. Edge agreed to this. A. McGuire-Forcier asked Jonathan Gallishaw if he wanted to report to the committee and add what he has researched. J. Gallishaw began with the $256,100 line item at the top of the page 1 of System Wide and McFee. He went through all line items of the budget and everything was accounted for except e-Learning Novanet licenses, Rosetta Stone and VHS. He doesn\u2019t know where those line items are listed in the budget. C. Roberts asked J. Gallishaw if the $256,100 is everything he needs. J. Gallishaw said that is correct. C. Roberts asked J. Gallishaw if he is going to go through every school and wherever there is a tech reference he needs to delete. J. Gallishaw said that is correct except for personnel and e-Learning.",
      "1",
      "A. McGuire-Forcier asked what library media is and it is budgeted at $201,190. J. Gallishaw will research this line item. Next line item on same page is regular salaries-direct for $35,792. This is the Directors of Grants and Assessment money and is paid through a grant, a 60/40 split. C. Roberts said we have a Special Ed Director, an Asst. Director of Special Ed, and two Coordinators of Special Ed and asked Carole Lerner for a break down what the Asst. Director is doing vs. the two Coordinators. C. Lerner said totally different job specs, different responsibilities and will send the Committee the job descriptions for their review. A. McGuire-Forcier said she is not in support of the Asst. Director of Special Ed position. C. Lerner said that you are not in support of this position with 1476 IEPs in the district and she thinks that they need to look at all the districts in the state. A. McGuire-Forcier said that we don\u2019t have an Asst. Deputy Superintendent and all the other districts have one. V. Phongsavanh said we do have the highest SPED population in the state. C. Roberts asked, just for discussion, are we facilitating that. C. Lerner said the opposite happens. Our numbers have gone down because we have better and tighter control over eligibility at meetings. C. Roberts asked if our IEPs have decreased. C. Lerner said yes and it is due to the tightening up of eligibility and having trained people facilitate the meetings so everyone doesn\u2018t get an IEP. G. Donoyan added that the coordinators in addition to the asst. director have made a conservative effort in bringing back some of our out of district placements. In bringing back just five children can be as much as a $300,000 in savings. C. Roberts said the next question he had highlighted was for the finance director and if we were going to take money from that position and add more to the accounting supervisor knowing that we advertise all positions as compensatory as experience and we can make a final offer. C. Roberts feels that posting the finance director position at $100,000 is competitive. Mr. Bruce makes $90,000 and other finance people make around the same and then we could add another $5000 to the accounting supervisor position. V. Phongsavanh disagrees with this and wants to keep it at $105,000 for the finance director and keep the accounting supervisor the way it is now. G. Donoyan said she has made herself pretty clear that because of the challenges that we have in this point of time, she suggests that we think about the salary that we budget for the finance director to maintain consistency so we can have someone stay here for awhile. She thinks it\u2019s really important to find enough to really enhance the professionalism that is required in this department and I don\u2019t want to see us go over budget on that one particular line where we will be ridiculed and criticized. W. Edge said the accounting supervisor is the key person for running the department and the finance director is the key person for interfacing and doing all the figures budgeted, negotiations, TANS, etc and without a good account supervisor, your finance director will be doing controller work and that won\u2019t be good. W. Edge said in today\u2019s environment anywhere from $90,000 to $120,000 is the going rate but this is a tough school district in financial confusion. C. Roberts asked what the salary should be for the accounting supervisor. W. Edge said $45,000 to $50,000. W. Edge said adding another $5000 to both line items will not hurt us. G. Donoyan said she would like to state one more time that it is imperative that we budget a little on the high end for the finance director and again she is leery about the committee being criticized about being over budget in this one particular area. Committee agreed to make the finance director line item budgeted for $105,000. J. Gallishaw said he just researched the line item for library media and that is the salaries for the elementary librarians. C. Roberts stated that there are librarians in the schools. The committee reviewed elementary schools and they were not listed so they will keep this line item in the budget. G. Donoyan asked if any of our elementary nurses travel from school to school. K. Lombardo said the nurses at the smaller schools do. Regular salaries under System Wide and McFee - C. Roberts said the whole section of regular salaries was highlighted and the directors were supposed to look into this because they were all blank. Will research and get back to the committee. Next is salaries-accounting supervision which nothing is budgeted for this year but it does say we spent $22,000. G. Donoyan said the person in that position was here in July, August, and September and it was also explained to her that someone came in from an accounting firm so I really don\u2019t know if that additional cost was charged to this account as well, therefore we need to keep this line item. C. Roberts said we need to keep it for a total of $47,500. W. Edge said this position is not in the personnel supplement so we need to keep this line item. G. Donoyan said this person would add to the leadership team here and I think to ensure that we have a real professional team that maybe $50,000 to $53,000 would be sufficient. W. Edge said his opinion is to keep between $45,000 to $50,000. Committee agreed on $47,500. C. Roberts asked what is regular salaries-security. G. Donoyan said not only was it not budgeted this year but it also looks like nothing was charged to that account. She will have P. Fontaine to research this item. W. Edge said Stacey didn\u2019t budget it and Dina didn\u2019t budget it. W. Edge said that Dina told him that as she went through line item by line item and when she found something that was in the wrong account, she didn\u2019t budget it, she went and put it in the right account. W. Edge asked Dina how can you spend X amount of dollars in an account that is not budgeted by you or Stacey. She said it was posted to the wrong account by accounts payable and move it somewhere else and I have this many journal entries. W. Edge said that if everybody is set at zero, leave it at zero. Various secretaries \u2013 C. Roberts said one is for $10,000. W. Edge said 70% federal, 30% WED. All tech questions are on J. Gallishaw\u2019s spreadsheet which he will give to C. Roberts. On page 3, there are two highlighted questions: Athletic Maintenance, Repairs and Maintenance and Repair, General \u2013 G. Donoyan said it is very possible that the expense was put in the wrong place. C. Roberts asked W. Edge if this could be a case where there are multiple line items for athletics so some could be posted here and then somewhere else. W. Edge said most definitely. There were two separate charts of accounts and Stacey was using one and Dina was using the other.",
      "2",
      "Example, the whole Bernon Shop was in two places and just about everything is in two places. W. Edge said he would keep whatever is budgeted under $10,000 in the line item. G. Donoyan said it is a time consuming effort to go line by line and knows it is very important to be as transparent when we talk about each line but W. Edge makes a good point. Materiality is very important, take a look at a bottom line base line and anything over $50,000 look at those first. A. McGuire-Forcier said lets just finish this section and move on the WMS, WHS, and WACTC. The schools will be much easier than this section. C. Roberts said they will continue with the highlighted areas that the committee had questions on. On Page 4, social studies for $15,837. A. McGuire-Forcier asked if this could be the instructional leader stipend. G. Donoyan said yes, 20 percent. C. Roberts asked how many instructional leaders because there are three under district wide. L. Filomeno said there are four. Data processing software \u2013 J. Gallishaw will give C. Roberts his report so he can update the data base with any highlighted questions the committee had on technology. Coaching \u2013 W. Edge you don\u2019t need to spend a lot of time on this section. C. Roberts said George Nasuti is our principal and also our athletic director. In this section it shows a $5,500 stipend and if you look at his salary as principal, it shows the $5,500 there. So did we budget this stipend twice. W. Edge said to take one stipend out. C. Roberts said in Bernon the principal salary will show $89,481. C. Roberts advised W. Edge that he deleted the ridiculous cheerleading number for $174,000. W. Edge said that is not a ridiculous number that is the actual number for all of them; they did it on one line item. Facilities \u2013 W. Edge pointed out that this is where the painter, carpenters, plumber line items are and if it wasn\u2019t for the new UCOA, those would have been all right here together. Now they are in Bernon Shop. All salaries are out of this page. The $9,670 is miscellaneous expenses. Fringe \u2013 highlighted were certified pension, MERS, and employee assist. A. McGuire-Forcier asked if anyone researched certified pension, we had a deficit of $393,325 and we are budgeting for $4.2M. G. Donoyan said maybe the deficit occurred because of miscalculations of estimated pensions, but not sure. W. Edge said that the deficit surplus column was calculated by taking what Stacey budgeted and backing out what Dina budgeted so the difference between $4.2M and $3.8M is the $393,325. That is not the deficit for the operating budget because we haven\u2019t finished that year so it is the projected deficit by Dina. Dina says it is a deficit because Stacey didn\u2019t budget enough but Dina does say that $4.2M is enough and the MERS pension which had every school in it and had everyone\u2019s pension did come out. A. McGuire-Forcier said we budget MERS pension at $676,288. However, back in 2011 was $36,249 and in 2012 is $111,542 and only in a deficit of $57,530 so why is it up to $676,288. W. Edge said that when he saw the numbers for North Providence, which increased by 6 percent, he wanted to protect us so he put a number comparable to North Providence. C. Roberts asked what\u2019s pushing that difference. W. Edge says the state gives numbers on how much you have to fund. The MERS program is the state\u2019s program. Employee assist \u2013 A. McGuire-Forcier said it was budgeted for $10,000, do we know what it is yet? W. Edge said no but it was in the budget twice (Bernon and Fringe) so took it out of Bernon. C. Roberts said the committee went over medical on Saturday and recently received Dina\u2019s excel spreadsheet and she is coming up with the FY12 projected of $8.9M and after talking with Norm St. Laurent, insurance broker, he is saying we should be expecting a 10% increase to $900,000. C. Roberts said we put in $1.4M for the retirees which is pretty accurate but we are still off a half of a million dollars. W. Edge said he thinks we are high by $1.6M and asked where the credit is? These are all debits where are your credits, where is the co-share paid by the employees at 20% of $8M. C. Roberts said Dina has a gross expenditure $9.9M just $900,000 less for grants. W. Edge said that there is a co-share by the employees of 20% of $9M would be $1.8M and it is a credit and they post it to the expense account, they don\u2019t post it to miscellaneous revenue. If you go to miscellaneous revenue there is no revenue for anything over $1M. G. Donoyan asked if the health premium projected by Dina was gross or net. W. Edge said that is a net number of all the things and at the bottom of Dina\u2019s spread sheet she has regular employees, pension employees and an offset for the co-share and you are easily coming to pay $10M in claims. C. Roberts said Dina has $9.9M before you take off any grant money. W. Edge said look at the miscellaneous revenue schedule, there is a Medicaid reimbursement number of $1.3M and that is not the same thing and he does not see another line item other than state aid that\u2019s over $1M and city appropriation so he is suggesting that whatever that number is (1.6, 1.8, or 1.2) has to go as a reduction of your claims made expenses. C. Roberts said Dina does have a co-share column for the projection of FY12 that totals $1.5M. W. Edge said that is about right. C. Roberts asked if we should add another line item to show the income and then increase the expense line again. C. Roberts stated that this is the probably the most important line item discussed. W. Edge said the committee did it different than Dina and he did it different than both so the $8.086M is right off of Darin\u2019s schedule as the amount of health insurance we pay for the working employees whether it is individual or family and that is a pretty good number and that is all employees including the federal. W. Edge said he took out $800,000 when he ran it without the federal people and he actually came up with $800,000 on just the federal. C. Roberts said Dina had $867,000 so we are playing it a little safe for the grant. W. Edge said he did the same thing with dental, he took out $50,000. In addition, he agrees that you need to put in the pension people because they are in mine in a net concept and you have to put in the revenues that we get from co-share which is $1.5M but he also had in there the concept of the overage (umbrella). A. McGuire-Forcier asked if we go over this item again tomorrow will we have a different dollar amount. W. Edge said our budget doesn\u2019t have anything in there for revenues and we need to put this in. C. Roberts requested a ten minute recess to review this section.",
      "3",
      "W. Edge feels that we don\u2019t have to break and the committee has to figure out how much the revenue will be, maybe only a half million less than what we have now and putting this in health insurance variables would make sense. Motion for a ten minute recess by: A. McGuire-Forcier 2nd: V. Phongsavanh Roll Call Vote: 3 Yes. Meeting called back to order at 5:37 p.m. by A. McGuire-Forcier. Roll call: V. Phongsavanh-Present; C. Roberts-Present; A. McGuire-Forcier-Present; E. Nadeau-Absent; J. Donlon-Absent. C. Roberts suggested we budget for $9.9M in total and we can also make an amendment going down and we will know that we are safe which includes the $1.4M and if the working rates come out to be less, then we can go back to City Council and say there is an amendment and we are lowering it by X amount of dollars. Committee agrees with C. Roberts for making the changes to reflect $8.5M for active and $1.4M for retirees. System Wide and McFee - Clerical School Committee - C. Roberts asked how many meetings a year. A. McGuire-Forcier said about 25 meeting a year with a few extra meetings in between. C. Roberts took 25 meetings with 7 hours on average multiplied by $23.40 gives you $4095. Committee agreed to give a $4000 stipend to this position. A. McGuire-Forcier suggested putting on the next agenda to have the recording clerk just take the votes. V. Phongsavanh said we need the minutes not just the votes. C. Roberts stated that he would take a different approach than the superintendent and feels that the clerk serves at the pleasure of the school committee not that it is always necessarily her secretary. A. McGuire-Forcier said it has always been this way, read the secretary\u2019s job description. C. Roberts said then where do you want to put the $4000. C. Roberts stated that when we have our organizational meeting, we are suppose to vote that night on who the clerk will be for the upcoming year. A. McGuire-Forcier said that the Superintendent is always the committee\u2019s clerk. A. McGuire-Forcier stated that Kim Blais takes the minutes, has taken over the position of the Superintendent\u2019s Secretary and to the School Committee while the other person is on leave, helps with the deputy work, and helps all the directors out that she knows and everybody says good things about her. V. Phongsavanh said that the Superintendent wants to reorganize the position, both positions. C. Roberts said if the $4000 is here we can transfer it after. A. McGuire-Forcier said she is not making enough now. At this time, G. Donoyan came back to the meeting and A. McGuire-Forcier said that they are trying to get the secretarial position corrected for FY13 budget and asked G. Donoyan what would be a good salary for someone to be your personal assistant or whatever title you want to give it. G. Donoyan stated that we are not attaching names to this; the position is what we are talking about not the person. G. Donoyan stated for the record that if there is no deputy superintendent or no assistant superintendent then that means that all of that work will continue to fall on my shoulders and I am going to ask the committee for a raise. A. McGuire-Forcier said you will have the right to ask the committee. G. Donoyan said other than that it is almost abusive of anyone to think that anyone can do two jobs so if that be the case, then she thinks that the committee will have to take a look at the positions. If it ends up having no deputy or no assistant, then there may have to be two executive assistants. If we do have a deputy or assistant, then we will have a secretary and an executive secretary for the superintendent. A. McGuire-Forcier said as it stands now we have $100,000 for a deputy so look at it that way. G. Donoyan said why don\u2019t we leave it as we have it right now that you have a secretary for that person and an executive assistant here and if you roll in the duties of the School Committee then it is only fair to jack it up to $6000. If you don\u2019t roll it up, then you have to put that aside as an additional stipend. C. Roberts said before you came out of your office we put aside $4000. G. Donoyan said with all the controversy we had and with all the special meetings we have had, that next year we will be even more transparent so she thinks it would be a really good idea to do this. A. McGuire-Forcier said yes, lets be safe and don\u2019t forget she is at all the meetings and re-living them. Committee agreed on $5000 and keeping this in the clerical line item until the job descriptions are done. W. Edge stated that at this point, we have $14M accounted for with the elementary schools, $16M plus in fringe benefits, $5M with system wide and McFee, $4M in tuitions and the only items left are the WMS, WHS, and WACTC. C. Roberts said we have Social to do as well and one item is $13,000 in oil heat. He stated that we should remove the line items for the lights, heat, and gas and leave the other line items in. He also stated that we cannot take out the sewer line item for Second Ave because we still have that building and suggested they move this line item to district wide. C. Roberts will talk with P. Fontaine to make sure the oil heat is for Social and not split between buildings. WACTC \u2013 Committee reviewed each line item dollar amount and noted if the salaries where for 1, 2 or more teachers. Culinary Arts \u2013 C. Roberts said the projection last year was $83,043, we had a $10,000 deficit, and this year is $143,807. Committee agreed to reduce this line item. The new total for this line item is $74,907. Hospitality and travel \u2013 nothing budgeted. Teacher salary is listed under business. The committee agreed to delete that line item and add that salary of $60,801 to the hospitality line item. G. Donoyan stated that we are not eliminating a position just reclassifying. A. McGuire-Forcier said yes. Computer position on the top of page 2 for $74,123 \u2013 the position is accounted for so keep this line item. Prof Teachers E-Learning \u2013 nothing budgeted. G. Donoyan said we have one person in that position of $69,384. Committee agreed to add that amount to line item. W. Edge said this position is also on page 3 under federal. Committee agreed to delete under federal because position is paid out of local. WACTC TAs \u2013 G. Donoyan said there are four SPED TA\u2019s and depending on enrollment, we may need more. G. Donoyan requested to go back to TA - E-Learning. Those four TAs are listed under E-Learning and we don\u2019t have one in E-Learning.",
      "4",
      "We have one in automotive, construction, child studies, and a 1on 1. Committee agreed to break up in separate areas and look up their salaries for that line item. G. Donoyan said the line item called TA for E-Learning should be changed to E-learning manager because there is nothing in there for this position and add $70,000 for salary. C. Roberts thought that this position was under McFee. Committee reviewed the McFee pages and the position was not listed. G. Donoyan said that this position will be different than the old position. This manager will oversee Novanet and the stuff that goes on at the WHS (curriculum, vendors, etc). This is not a teaching position. V. Phongsavanh feels that $70,000 is too much. A. McGuire-Forcier said we need to find out what the old position paid. C. Roberts asked who does this person and the E-Learning teacher report to. G. Donoyan said teacher reports to principal and manager reports to J. Gallishaw. C. Roberts asked if there is a document that shows what money E-Learning brings in. G. Donoyan said it doesn\u2019t bring in money at this point in time but it is her business plan to make it large enough so we start to charge tuition. G. Donoyan will research what the old position paid and report back to the committee to add in that dollar amount for manager. Student summer hourly for $3835 is for summer school. WACTC summer hourly print line item for $4,343 is for printing the student handbooks. Lights at $104,506, keep as is. A. McGuire-Forcier told the committee to finish the WHS and WMS section during the May 23rd School Committee meeting because those schools will be much easier to do. She also stated that the committee can do first passage of the budget after the review of the last two schools and then the committee can do second passage when she returns from the Ohio conference. G. Donoyan would like to bring a couple of things to the committee\u2019s attention. She said look at WMS. There is an area that is referred to as federal grants and under the current program, we still need St. Mary\u2019s classrooms at the WMS and that is not budgeted. For 2011, we budgeted for $209,600. W. Edge said look under tuitions. Committee looked at St. Mary\u2019s tuition and it is still not budgeted. A. McGuire-Forcier asked W. Edge to look into this and call the Superintendent. Until then, the committee agreed to add in $209,600 and will adjust this line item later so it doesn\u2019t hold up 1st passage of the budget. G. Donoyan said she is very leery about the WMS and WHS, it might sound like an easy budget to take a look at but even L. Filomeno just brought up some items that might be listed under federal like ESL. Even though the program is mandated by the federal law, we can\u2019t use federal Title III money to buy a teacher. G. Donoyan said she wants to make sure that the federal dollars associated with everybody really, truly are federal dollars. Motion for a ten minute recess by: A. McGuire-Forcier 2nd: C. Roberts Roll Call Vote: 3 Yes. Meeting called back to order at 6:35 p.m. by A. McGuire-Forcier. Roll call: V. Phongsavanh-Present; C. Roberts-Present; A. McGuire-Forcier-Present; E. Nadeau-Absent; J. Donlon-Absent. WMS \u2013 The committee moved the guidance people out of SPED and moved into local. They also moved the English ESL teachers into local. W. Edge said on the last page of WMS under the federal, the first two line items have money budgeted and that should be zero. Therefore, on Page 1, supervision-guidance add $232,869 to that line item and on Page 2, English ESL add 137,590 to that line item. W. Edge said since we are on federal, let\u2019s review the WHS federal page and fix the guidance line item. This too should be at zero. Therefore, take the $291,244 and put under the Prof Teachers - guidance line item on Page 2. WMS - Committee reviewed each line item dollar amount and noted if the salaries where for 1, 2 or more teachers. G. Donoyan stated that the director line item is Jonathan Gallishaw, and the coordinator supervisor should really say SPED coordinator supervisor who is Rick Ferguson. The multi graded line item is a science teacher. WMS Expenses \u2013 G. Donoyan asked if classroom educational supplies are for all classrooms and all content areas because it doesn\u2019t seem right. Art supplies for both of the middle schools are only $2500. G. Donoyan asked how can you teach art without any supplies and family and consumer science without all the necessary supplies. Committee agreed to budget the art line item at $5000 and family and consumer science line item at $5000. Committee agreed to budget the music supply line item to $1000. Other professionals \u2013 W. Edge said Stacey had this line item at $277,000 and Dina had it at $280,000 so kept this line item at $280,000. W. Edge said he does not know what this line item is but he does know that it is not teachers. G. Donoyan will research this line item and report back to the committee. G. Donoyan stated that the textbooks line item is only at $5000. G. Donoyan said it is really important that we look at textbooks. If we give social studies $10,000, we also have to give to the math, science, and English line items. A. McGuire-Forcier asked how many children in our middle schools. G. Donoyan said 1400. A. McGuire-Forcier suggested that this line item be budgeted at $50,000 because it is desperately needed for the kids. C. Roberts suggested we budget this line item at $12,000. G. Donoyan said to C. Roberts that your responsibility as a School Committee person is for the education of these children. We are also the stewards and have a fiduciary responsibility as well. What we are doing here is first and foremost priority, what are the needs for these children and then we talk about the finances. She hopes that the finances are not driving what is in the best practice of our children. A. McGuire-Forcier and V. Phongsavanh agreed to budget at $50,000 and C. Roberts did not agree. Science supplies \u2013 nothing was allocated at the WMS or the WHS. At this time the Committee agreed to go to Page 3 on McFee and system wide and delete the words \u201cmath system wide\u201d and make that line item read workbook/consumables and budget that line item for $75,000.",
      "5",
      "WHS \u2013 G. Donoyan to research the line item that reads Asst. Principal of Academy for $89,481 and report back to committee with her findings. Under professional teachers \u2013 math, we need to add in one math teacher because the teacher that is retiring this year has been removed from this line item. Committee agreed to add an additional $73,123 plus fringe at $25,000 to the math teachers budget line. General SPED line item is budgeted at $659,518. C. Roberts said this line item consists of eleven teachers plus $400.00 and asked if the $400.00 is for overage. W. Edge said it could be but is not sure so take out the $400.00. Committee agreed to take out the $400.00 and that line item is now budgeted at $695,118. Custodial supervisor overtime line item is budgeted at $5000 and A. McGuire-Forcier asked why the supervisor makes more in overtime. G. Donoyan said that every time someone goes out, which is in the contract, even if it is for ten minutes, they get paid for three hours. She also stated that sometimes when there is an after school activity and they are there an hour after, they actually get paid for three hours. The committee reviewed the WHS expense line items. Discussion was made around hockey and how it is such an expensive sport. C. Roberts stated that there are approximately eight kids on the team. G. Donoyan said what they did in North Providence was merge their team with Johnston. A. McGuire-Forcier said maybe we could talk to Cumberland, Lincoln or Mount about merging our team. G. Donoyan said we might not be able to do this with interscholastic. Committee agreed to have G. Donoyan call George Nasuti to look into this. A. McGuire-Forcier said take a look at purchased services FOCUS line item at $59,520 and asked what this is. G. Donoyan stated that is purchased services for the FOCUS program. V. Phongsavanh said in 2011 it was $2700 and now it is budgeted at $59,520 and asked why it went up so high. G. Donoyan said there has been a tremendous amount of kids in this program, so it has expanded. C. Roberts said the art supplies line item is at $2500. Committee agreed to budget the line item at $5000. C. Roberts said look at the science supplies line item budgeted at $4755. Committee agreed to budget the line item at $8000. Family and consumer science supply line item is budgeted at $2250. Committee agreed to budget the line item at $5000. Technical art supply line item is budgeted at $1337. Discussion was held regarding robotics class and G. Donoyan said the teacher should be submitting to us the plan for next year but this has never been done so our people do not know how to do this. Committee agreed to budget the line item at $5000. Music supply line item is budgeted at $2900. Committee agreed to budget the line item at $4000. G. Donoyan said take a look at the graduation expense line item for $705 and the graduation supplies line item at $2368. Committee agreed these line items are good the way they are budgeted. G. Donoyan said the textbooks social studies line item had $32,500 and they used $25,711 and it is still budgeted at $25,711. A. McGuire-Forcier said to take some of these monies and put it towards the science and math textbooks. C. Roberts suggested making the social studies line item at $5711 and adding $10,000 to each line item for math and science. Committee agreed that the social studies textbooks line items will be budgeted at $5711, textbooks for math will be budgeted at $13,465 and textbooks for science will be budgeted at $15,368. C. Roberts said that we need to add a line item under deficit reduction for $2M. W. Edge asked if the $7M deficit is going to be part of what they are trying to get for you and if it is, why would you only put $2M in. A. McGuire-Forcier said that they are only raising taxes to get a little over $3M so to budget this line item at $2M makes sense. C. Roberts asked why do some the WMS guidance get a $69,000 stipend. G. Donoyan said they are team leaders, one in each school, and those positions are contractual. A. McGuire-Forcier suggested to the committee not to vote for first passage this evening and wait until Wednesday if Dr. Donoyan is able to get us this information by Wednesday. Committee agreed. A .McGuire-Forcier asked C. Roberts to tally up the numbers and give us the total budget amount. G. Donoyan stated that the draft budget was at $64.5M. We made some adjustments up to $2.596M which gave us $67,096M. G. Donoyan asked C. Roberts what are the total adjustments we made tonight. C. Roberts stated that we added $2M for the deficit reduction so the budget amount as of May 18, 2012 is $70,613,739. He also stated that it is important for the people to know that the $2M is a debt that we are paying back not expenses. Motion to adjourn at 8:12: V. Phongsavanh 2nd: A. McGuire-Forcier Roll Call Vote: 3 yes. Respectfully Submitted: Kimberly Blais, WSC Recording Secretary",

Michael O\u2019Keefe started the meeting by introducing Karen Grande, Esq., Bond Counsel to the City from Edwards, Wildman and Palmer, LLP.

In revaluation years, the home values change. In order to obtain the same levy as the prior year, if the values increase, then the tax rates decrease. Conversely if the values decrease then the tax rates must increase. She noted that the charter language stated \u201cdeemed to be 103.5% or less\u201d, which meant that that the rates would reset to 0 in any tax revaluation year. The rate is essentially treated as if it were 103.5% of the prior year\u2019s tax rate even though the actual rate change may be greater than 103.5%. In conclusion, the resetting of the City\u2019s tax rate in an revaluation year will not cause the City to exceed the 3.5% tax rate cap, provided however, that the City must comply with the tax levy cap set forth in Section 44-5-2 of the Rhode Island General Laws. Agenda Item #2 Resolution to approve $2.0 million in Tax Anticipation Notes: This item was unanimously approved.",
      "Page 2 of 3",
      "Agenda Item #3 Resolution to approve $8.0 million in Bond Anticipation Notes for the wastewater improvements: This item was unanimously approved. Part two of Item #3 Cash Flow: Christy Healey presented this item and discussed the May impact from the $2.0 million in TANS. The City was projecting a deficit of approximately $180,000 in May that would be overcome by holding off on several payments. Agenda Item #4 Approval of procurement and/or payments in excess of $25,000 and under $25,000: Christy Healey presented the list and informed the Commission to disregard payments on page 26 and page 27 in the supporting documents as they were already approved payments and inadvertently included. The Commission unanimously approved this item. See addendum #1 for the list of City approvals over $25,000. Agenda Item #5 EPSD request to fill positions: Edward Daft presented the lists of staffing requests for placement of displaced teachers, recall of layoff teachers and posting of open positions. The Budget Commission approved delegating its\u2019 hiring and transfer authority to Mr. Daft for transfers and recalls for teachers. The Commission also approved hiring a Special Education Multidisciplinary position, which would result in savings by bringing out-of-district students back into the district; a Special Education Coordinator which was a downgrade of the vacant Special Education Director position; and the Director of Education position which would assist the Interim Superintendent, as the Superintendent used to have 5 administrative positions and now only has 1 position; a Custodian due to 3 vacancies, however only 1 will be needed as the custodian from Burnside will be reassigned; and 2 school secretaries. The Commission requested additional information on the Evaluation Team Leader position and the RTT Coordinator position. See Addendum #2 for the lists of positions and displacements, indicating the fiscal impact associated with each request. Agenda Item #6 Request for performance increases for EPSD administrative staff per individual contracts: Mr. Daft presented the list of personnel that would be entitled to performance raises. Mr. O\u2019Keefe asked if all employees whose contracts included performance bonuses were getting them. Mr. Daft stated that was correct. Val Lawson, NEA President requested to comment, and noted that she objected to the raises, particularly because the teachers were the lowest paid in the state. Mr. O\u2019Keefe asked for the performance evaluation criteria and asked for the item to be moved to the next meeting for further discussion. Agenda Item #7 EPSD request for renewal of food service contract: Mr. Daft presented this one year renewal of the current 5 year contract to the Budget Commission, and the item was unanimously approved. Agenda Item #8 Request for change order for wastewater improvement project: Peter Graczykowski presented the request to add additional instrumentation to the wastewater project that was not within the initial scope of work. The instrumentation is being required by the RIDEM and the funding will be provided within the current contract costs due to unused unit quantities within the Bike Path portion of the project. The Budget Commission unanimously approved this item.",
      "Page 3 of 3",
      "Agenda Item #9 Initial request to approve Reverse E-911 Emergency Notification System Contract: Wayne Barnes presented the item to the Commission and will act on final approval in the next meeting. Agenda Item #10 Initial review of a five year renewal of the ACS contract in the City Clerk\u2019s Office: Mr. O\u2019Keefe requested the Information Technology Director analyze the contract and to have the City Clerk present at the next Commission meeting. Agenda Item #11 Update on proposed charter changes: Peter Graczykowski presented his proposed Charter Amendments to the Commission for informational purposes only, as the Commission has no jurisdiction over charter changes. Agenda Item #12 Review and approval of minutes from May 10, 2012. These minutes were approved unanimously. Agenda Item #13 Request for amendment to the Rainy Day Fund ordinance: Michael O\u2019Keefe presented the first reading for the amendment.

      "GUEST/CUSTOMER BUSINESS: None. SEWER TIE-IN APPLICATIONS: 671-673 Washington St (DeOliveira): Mike Saccoccia is present for the applicant. He said it is a simple duplex with one tie-in for both units. He has a copy of the letter from Weston & Sampson and has no problem addressing the engineer\u2019s concerns. The clerk read Resolution #2012-5. Councilman McGee motioned to accept the resolution, Mr. Spada seconded. All voted Aye, motion carried. REPORTS: Contract 6: Mr. Yaceshyn handed out his report. The three easements are still outstanding. Contract 6A: Half of the punch list is complete. Mr. Joyal will call R.T. Nunes to clarify the paving issue. Councilman McGee motioned to modify the agenda to vote on a recommendation to the Town Council regarding the easements from 61 Arizona & 26 Lakeside. Messrs. Colaluca and Skurka seconded, all voted Aye, motion carried. Mr. Sprague said 26 Lakeside wants their fence replaced, their tie-in done and an abatement of their taxes. Mr. Hoover said this (the tax abatement for sewers) is unprecedented, Chairman Hall agrees. Chairman Hall motioned to recommend that the Town Council grant the requests to replace the fence and tie them in but not to abate any taxes. Councilman McGee seconded, all voted Aye, motion carried. 61 Arizona would like to be tied in and have their sewer assessment abated in full. Chairman Hall said there has never been an abatement given on an assessment. Mr. Hoover reminded the SSC that the sewer fund is an enterprise fund and everyone must be treated equally. Chairman Hall is not comfortable abating assessments. Two houses will benefit from this easement. Chairman Hall motioned to recommend that the Town Council grant the request for tie-in but not abate the assessment. Mr. Spada seconded, all voted Aye, motion carried. Contract 7: Mr. Hoover handed out a report and said the Main St/Industrial Dr Sewer Project is combination gravity line/forced main sewers due to different grades. It will pick up 17 commercial properties (Boston Scientific, Rebuilders Auto Supply, Gtech and others) and 19 residential properties. All the alternates provided by James J. Geremia & Associates, Inc. exceeded the grant amount. The alternate chosen costs $3.4 million. Mr. Przybyla procured $1.1 million from Clean Water Financing so there will be enough money to extend the line to the Town Hall Annex building and DPW at no extra cost to the taxpayers. Mr. Hoover recommends that the Main St/Industrial Dr Sewer Project include the Town Hall Annex building and DPW and recommends pursuing the Private sewer line. Chairman Hall asked what the timetable was to complete the plans, send it out to bid and complete the work. Mr. Hoover said the grant requires construction to start by September 2012 and be complete by September 2013. He thinks the federal funds should be kept separate from the money being borrowed; the Clean Water money can\u2019t be accessed until November. Mr. Skurka motioned to modify the agenda to allow resulting action based on the recommendation of the Town Manager in respect to Contract 7. Mr. Spada seconded, all voted Aye, motion carried. Chairman Hall motioned to designate the Town Hall extension as Contract 7A and to",
      "Page 3 of 3",
      "Sewer Subcommittee May 21, 2012",
      "recommend to the Town Council to go into design and construction, Messrs Skurka and Spada seconded. All vote Aye, motion carried. OLD BUSINESS: Private Sewer Line: Mr. Hoover said the Court appointed an attorney who is attempting to sell the line. Offers have been traded and hopefully the Town\u2019s latest will be accepted. If it is, he will be looking for a recommendation from the SSC. NEW BUSINESS: Conceptual approval Anthony Mill, 618 Washington St: Kevin Morin from DiPrete Engineering is present for the applicant. The original project went into receivership and was put on hold. Mr. Morin said the plan received Planning Commission approval in April for 125 residential units, mostly two bedrooms, two outbuildings and the main mill. There are two laterals on the site now but a pump station is needed because of the aqueduct that runs through the building. Chairman Hall asked if the back building would also be tied in; Mr. Morin answered no. The Anthony Mill is not currently tied-in and the 3-4 cesspools on site can\u2019t serve the project. All the units will be market rate; no low income. Chairman Hall explained that conceptual approval is at the request of the Planning Commission and doesn\u2019t constitute tie-in approval; it just shows the Planning Department that there is capacity for the project. He read Resolution #2012-7. Councilman McGee motioned to approve the resolution, Mr. Skurka seconded. All voted Aye, motion carried. Resolution to the Town Council for substantial completion of Tiogue Ave Sewer Extension Project, Contract 6A: Tabled to June. July and August meeting dates: The clerk notified the subcommittee that the Town Council didn\u2019t schedule a meeting on July 16, 2012 so the alternate meeting date of July 9, 2012 is not needed. Councilman McGee motioned to move the July 9, 2012 meeting to July 16, 2012 pending availability of the room. Mr. Spada seconded, all voted Aye, motion carried. Public/Subcommittee Member comment: Denis Levesque of 1319 Main St is questioning what he heard about not having to pay his assessment unless he ties in. He wants to know what happens if he sells his property. Chairman Hall said it would be the his responsibility to disclose the future sewer debt. Charles Nichols of 38 Lakeside Dr thanked the SSC for all the work they have done for him and his wife so far and asked what was next. Chairman Hall told him to see Stephani In at the Town Manager\u2019s office for a tie-in application. Mr. Skurka asked if the residents would be assessed and not have to pay until they tie-in or just not be assessed. Chairman Hall said he will get clarification on this. Councilman McGee motioned to adjourn, Councilman Mattson seconded. All voted Aye, motion carried. Meeting adjourned at 8:04pm."

      "4. Old Business Director Taylor gave us an update on the current state budget deliberations as they relate to funding of DEA and community grants for senior services at the next meeting. RIPAE has $100K for reimbursements, checks are been mailed to about 300 people, some people do not qualify any more because of the income topping. The expenditures were $ 190K. They are in the process of matching utilities with folks that apply this year. There is help with the paper filling and some are applying, they must have part D in order to qualify and to get help for people in the doughnut hole. The March 31 deadline has been extended. One of the delays has to do with the fact they are no replacement cards, they are expensive to process ($9.000), the new cards will have a 2018 expiration date. There has been a 175K request for funding. On the Budget: DEA had a 25% cut in community services grants. There was a House Finance call to testify so Directors went to testify including Ms. Taylor. Nothing is resolved yet but there is some support to keep some money for the Senior Centers instead of cuts all across the board. Documentation of the services provided has become very important to allocate monies. Our charter has the specific mission to preserve the dignity of the seniors and we would help as needed. The Governor has asked for moneys to cover the $380K overrun on assistant living (115 waiver clients).",
      "Still there is no long term regulations from the Alliance, they have been working now for a year and are still in a draft format. The regulations have to reflect the Federal Government programs and requirements; the biggest problem is the lack of knowledge about the role of the Alliance and the Federal Government. Regulations such as the ombudsman job, it has to be separate from the executive director, one person can not have the two jobs. Or the role of the Alliance in regard to adult protective services, the Federal regulations says the abuse situation has to be reported to the Health Department, the situation can only be assessed and then DOH takes over. The draft need to be re-written with a hearing to follow and that way the Alliance will have a better understanding of their role. 5. New Business",
      "The \u201crebalancing and nursing homes\u201d update for the cost base vs. the price base will take a few years to implement. There is the need for consensus and to include the impact of the Health Care Reform. There are lots of questions about the non-profit and the profit impact on any decision. Director Taylor is having a meeting this afternoon (May 23) about the question \u201cdoes money follows the person\u201d? There is joint RI meeting planned for the Alzheimer and the Dementia organizations to investigate resources because we do not have tools to deal with the situations. From funding to day centers, to the role of the ombudsman, to retaliation, to the prison population, to education to the general public and the impaired people and finally to cultural differences \u2013 it is necessary and important that there is a conversation between all parties. Suggestions such as PSA are needed to the general public about Alzeimers and Dementia and the resources available; just as important is the help that the caregivers need in order to continue with the care. Also that the September meeting could be geared to this issue. The recruiting of new members has to continue especially for people with different knowledge and more important with different connections.",

Other Business Review of NBC\u2019s Draft Fiscal Year 2013 Operating Budget Committee Chairman Andrade turned the meeting over to Karen Giebink for the NBC FY 2013 Proposed Operating Budget presentation. Ms. Giebink distributed a draft Narragansett Bay Commission FY 2013 Operating Budget presentation booklet to each member of the Finance Committee. Ms. Giebink began by reviewing the Budget preparation process which she stated started back in October. She advised the Committee that Pages one through three of the presentation highlight the Budget Considerations including regulation by the PUC with respect to Restricted Funds and Rate Relief as well as constraints set forth in the NBC Trust Indenture and Supplemental Indentures. She noted that the NBC faces a number of constraints as part of the budget preparation process and therefore review of operational and financial information takes place throughout the year to ensure that NBC has sufficient revenues to support its operating and capital needs. She also noted that the PUC has restricted the revenues associated with NBC\u2019s revenue requirement for debt service and debt service coverage. She explained that NBC\u2019s operating budget may only be funded from unrestricted revenues and that the NBC must expend and manage its resources in accordance with the Trust Indenture and Fifteen Supplemental Indentures executed as part of the issuance of Revenue Bonds. The Trust Indenture further restricts the use of NBC funds and assets which also affects the operating budget. Ms. Giebink next reviewed the Preliminary FY 2012 Budget Projections on Page 4. She advised that this is something that staff has been developing over time at Committee Chairman Andrade\u2019s request to see how NBC will finish the current fiscal year compared to the budget. With respect to FY 2012, she noted that it is projected that NBC will come in significantly under budget again and this is detailed under the expenses chart on Page 4. Projections show that Operations & Maintenance will finish $2.2 million under and with respect to Debt Service, $3.2 million under. Ms. Giebink also noted that with respect to revenues we are also projecting to end the year a little bit lower as discussed at Finance Committee meetings earlier in the year. Some of the factors contributing to lower revenues are consumption adjustments, flat fees being down and a drop in connection and permit fees as a result of the current economy. She also discussed the FY 2012 Budget vs. Projected Revenues and reviewed the Revenue Analysis with the Committee.",
      "2",
      "Sherri Arnold reviewed the FY 2012 Operating Budget by Major Line Item, Budget vs. Projected perations & Maintenance, Personnel Costs and Debt Service with the Committee. She noted that NBC is projecting to finish the year $ 3.2 million under budget. She stated that personnel costs are projected to be lower than the budgeted amount and that is due to turnover and added that, as a result, retirement, healthcare and related benefits will also be lower than their budgeted amounts. The expenses for electricity, natural gas and chemicals are all projected to be lower than the budgeted amount based on lower than projected usage; however, bio-solids expense is projected to be slightly higher than budgeted amount due to an increase in the disposal rate. Ms. Giebink advised that overall, NBC is projecting FY 2012 O&M expenses to be under budget. Regarding debt service, nearly $1.8 million in saving in debt service is anticipated to be realized from the VRDB\u2019s as a result of historically low short-term interest rates. She also noted that, the NBC will not incur programmed debt service costs associated with SRF borrowings as the loan is not scheduled to close until June 2012. She advised that Page 11 of the presentation shows the FY 2013 Operating Budget overview. She noted that we are looking at a budget that is 3.3% higher than last year with Operations & Maintenance expense a modest 0.4% above last year\u2019s budget and a 6.9% increase for debt service. Debt service coverage is 6.6% lower and Capital Outlays are 29.7% higher. Overall, the total expenses total 3.3% higher than the prior year. With respect to FY 2013 projected revenues on Page 12, there will be an increase in User Fees for FY 2013 of approximately $1.77 million and, effective 7/1/2012 there will be an increase in user charge rate of 2.25% for debt. She noted that the revenues are based upon approved levels and that the Operating Revenue Stability Fund authorized by the PUC, may be used by NBC to meet its financial obligations during periods of revenue fluctuation. She also noted that there will be an increase in BOD/TSS surcharges, a reduction in Sewer Connection Permit Fees, an inclusion of $950,000 Revenue Fund Balance and a decrease in Miscellaneous Revenues (stand-by electricity generation contract) for FY 2013. Ms. Giebink also reviewed with the Committee and explained the Projected Fund Balance as of June 30, 2012, a chart showing actual and projected user fees from FY 2009 through FY 2013 and the NBC Rate History from 7/1/2009 through 7/1/2012. She noted that the NBC has not had a rate increase for Operations and Maintenance since July 1, 2009, but there are a number of new facilities coming on-line during the upcoming fiscal year. She added that the increased costs were absorbed in the FY 2013 budget but that NBC won\u2019t be able to go another year without coming back before the Board of Commissioners for rate relief for Operations & Maintenance expenses. The rate relief would be for FY 2014 and is related to the new facilities required to meet higher levels of treatment. She advised that in the interim, staff may also have to come before the Board for rate relief related to debt service as the capital program begins to heat up. NBC is in the middle of a lot of construction and depending on the timing of the cash flows would determine whether or not there is a need to issue revenue bonds and this would be presented to the Board for their review as well. Ms. Giebink advised that Page 14 outlines the FY 2013 Expense Assumptions. The budget is based on the Strategic Plan and the Strategic Plan goals are outlined on this page. The table at the bottom of the page shows how the Actions for Achievement by Strategic Plan Goal are aligned. Most of them are associated with Core Business and Financial Management. Page 15 explains the balancing of the 2013 Budget and the Budget Changes by Major Line Item. The original FY 2013 Budget requests were cut by almost $3 million dollars and the revised Operations and Maintenance costs for FY 2013 are just slightly higher than the FY 2012 Budget.",
      "3",
      "Ms. Arnold reviewed the FY 2013 Operating Budget Significant Changes on Page 16 which compares the FY 2012 Budget to upcoming FY 2013 Budget. She advised that Personnel costs have increased from the prior year by 1.5 % as union salaries, health insurance and union retirement health insurance have increased. The majority of all the O & M costs have decreased with the exception of bio-solids expense. She noted that budgeted professional services also decreased from the prior year. Overall, from FY 2013 to FY 2012 there is just a 0.4 % increase in Operating and Maintenance costs. Ms. Arnold reviewed Pages 17 through 27 in detail with the Committee. Some of the noted items were that this year\u2019s budget includes a decrease in budgeted turnover of 0.3 FTE\u2019s to a total of 2.5 FTE\u2019s. In accordance with the collective bargaining agreement, salaries of union employees include a 2% COLA along with step increases. NBC\u2019s contribution rate to the RI State Retirement System on behalf of union employees decreased from 22.98% to 22.18% and NBC\u2019s contribution rate to the State Retirement Health benefit on behalf of union employees increased from 6.74% to 6.86%. This budget also reflects an increase in health insurance premiums of 8.0% which is offset in part by an increase in employee premium co-payments to 16% (based on a percentage of salary). The average budgeted co-pay is 14.78%. There was discussion between the Committee members and Finance staff regarding the potential impact on the NBC\u2019s Budget resulting from the change in the State retirement requirements and pension issues facing the union employees. Ms. Arnold advised that regarding the Operating Supplies and Expenses, the overall budget for electricity is approximately $62K lower in FY 2013 due to lower projected kWh usage for both Bucklin Point and IM; which offsets the projected increase for the BNR Facilities at Field\u2019s Point of $1.2 million. The FY 2013 electricity budget reflects a higher supply rate of $.08635 which is a 6.3% increase to the current supply rate which terminates on January 31, 2013. This rate is conservative the current standard offer is $.07645. The rate reduction combined with the potential operation of the wind turbines in FY 2013 would significantly reduce this expense. Ms. Arnold stated that the Bio-solids Disposal budget is $128K higher due to a 3.12% increase. Overall the budget for chemicals Hypochlorite and Sodium Bisulfite is projected to be $88,000 lower and that is a result of lower usage. The Bucklin Point Management Contract is budgeted $50,000 higher and that is a result of a 2.3% CPI Increase. Ms. Arnold advised the Committee that in the presentation booklet there are charts showing the electricity, gas, bio-solids, and chemicals that include the twelve month moving average for each. She noted that natural gas projected usage is approximately level for most of the facilities with the additional usage built in for the new Operations building at Field\u2019s Point overall lower expense and lower usage. Ms. Arnold next discussed the FY 2013 Operating Capital. She stated that some of the larger expenses this year will be for Server Infrastructure for all of NBC, NBC Campus Wide Security and equipment for the Ernest Street Pump Station. Ms. Giebink reviewed the Debt Service portion of the presentation in detail with the Committee. Noted is that our operating capital outlays are up significantly from prior years basically because we need to make investments in our aging equipment. With respect to debt service, she indicated that this is based on the long-term financial model prepared by the Financial Advisor which ties into Capital Improvement Program which was reviewed and approved by the Board last month. Ms. Giebink also advised that the bottom of Page 29 has a chart which details the Capital Improvement Program. A motion was made by Commissioner Kimball to present NBC\u2019s FY 2013 Draft Operating Budget to the full Board. Commissioner DiChiro seconded the motion and the vote taken by the Finance Committee was unanimous.",

      "NEW SHOREHAM SCHOOL COMMITTEE MEETING Block Island School",
      "May 21, 2012 7:00 p.m.",
      "The New Shoreham School Committee met in open session on Monday, May 21, 2012, in the media center of the Block Island School. Chair William Padien called the meeting to order at 7:25 p.m. The following members were present: Patricia Doyle, Ann Hall, Sean McGarry, and William Padien. Elizabeth Connor was not in attendance. Robert Hicks was also present. Approval of Minutes A motion (McGarry, Padien) to approve the minutes of the meeting held on April 9, 2012, as presented carried with a vote of 4-0. A motion (McGarry, Hall) to approve the minutes of the meeting held on April 30, 2012, as presented carried with a vote of 4-0. Reports Mr. Hicks submitted a flyer on the Rhode Island Growth Model, \u201ca statistical model that provides a new, more comprehensive way of looking at student achievement by enabling us to look at growth from one year to the next, in addition to proficiency in any given year.\u201d In addition, he submitted Block Island School\u2019s growth model, explaining that the higher you are on the graph the better your proficiency and the farther to the right the better the growth, with both our reading and math scores in the \u201cnortheast\u201d quadrant. The finance report through April 30, 2012, was submitted, showing a projected fund balance of $34,393. Mr. Hicks feels this is a conservative estimate. A motion (Padien, Doyle) to accept the finance report through April 30, 2012, as presented carried with a vote of 4-0. Old Business \u2013 2012-2013 Budget Mr. Hicks reported that the voters approved the Town Council\u2019s recommended school budget, which was $31,571 less than we requested. Mr. Hicks would prefer to have final numbers for health care and state aid before bringing an updated budget back to the committee for approval. New Business A motion (Padien, Hall) to approve the posting of Policy HIA: Student Activities Advisors for the required 30-day period carried with a vote of 4-0. A motion (Padien, Hall) to approve the posting of Policy FBF: Graduation Requirements for the required 30-day period carried with a vote of 4-0. A motion (Padien, Hall) to approve the posting of Policy GM: School Wellness for the required 30-day period carried with a vote of 4-0.",
      "2",
      "Monty Stover was in attendance to discuss the current school year\u2019s dental contract and apologized for submitting it to the committee in May. He hopes to take a closer look at the budget numbers for next year\u2019s contract before bringing it to the committee, perhaps in September. He corrected a typo in the contract, which was signed earlier in the day by Pam Hinthorn, Block Island Health Services President. A motion (Padien, Doyle) to approve and sign the dental contract with the Block Island Medical Center for the 2011-2012 school year carried with a vote of 4-0. A motion (Padien, Hall) to consent to the appointment of Scott Nelson as a custodian at the rate of $16.50 per hour and as the maintenance supervisor with a $10,000 stipend carried with a vote of 3-1 with Sean McGarry voting in the negative. Mr. McGarry felt that it is a conflict of interest for the same person to hold both positions. A motion (Padien, Hall) to consent to the appointment of Kristine Monje to the math support position for the 2012-2013 school year carried with a vote of 3-1 with Sean McGarry voting in the negative. Mr. McGarry stated that a job description was never presented to the committee and the position should have been advertised on SchoolSpring to draw a larger applicant pool. A motion (Padien, McGarry) to consent to the extended school year appointments of Victoria Carson as a special education teacher, Kathleen Schlenz as the occupational therapist, Pat O\u2019Leary as the physical therapist; and Martha Velie-Gass as a special education teacher carried with a vote of 4-0. A motion (Padien, Hall) to consent to the reappointments of Patricia Balles \u2013 Administrative Assistant, Marianne Brown \u2013 Bus Monitor, Pamela Buol \u2013 Teacher Assistant, John Canole \u2013 Principal, Virginia Collins \u2013 Food Service Helper, Scott Comings \u2013 Educational Consultant, Lynne Cunningham \u2013 Office Manager, Sarah Deane \u2013 Food Service Helper, Amy Dugan \u2013 Teacher Assistant, Lynn Fletcher \u2013 Custodian, Betty Gomes \u2013 Guidance Counselor, Marsha Gutierrez \u2013 Administrative Assistant, Mark Hawk \u2013 Special Education Director, Stacy Henshaw \u2013 Teacher Assistant, Bernice Johnson \u2013 Custodian, Karen Kurzman \u2013 Principal, and Renee Meyer \u2013 Finance Director carried with a vote of 4-0. A motion (Padien, Hall) to consent to the reappointments of Shannon Morgan \u2013 Cultural Activities Coordinator, Lisa Robb \u2013 Teacher Assistant, Jill Seppa \u2013 Cultural Activities Coordinator, and Hank Woodward \u2013 Technology Specialist carried with a vote of 4-0. It was noted that members of the New Shoreham Employees\u2019 Association would receive raises in accordance with the recently signed wage agreement. It was requested that Shannon Morgan and Jill Seppa report to the School Committee on this past year\u2019s activities and what they have in mind for next year. Mr. Hicks explained that the increase in salaries/wages for the finance director, administrative assistant, non-certified personnel, and athletic personnel was modeled on the collective bargaining unit for the town employees, which is a net increase of about two percent. The part-time certified personnel (principals, guidance counselor, special education director, and superintendent) took a freeze last year with the town employees and Mr. Hicks suggested that",
      "3",
      "their salaries be increased by half of a percent, which is the amount the teacher scale increased last year. A motion (Padien, Hall) to approve the non-union salaries (Finance Director $47,918; Administrative Assistant $66,212; an overall two percent increase for athletic and non-certified personnel; and an increase of 0.5 percent for the principals, guidance counselor, special education director, and superintendent carried with a vote of 4-0. Calendar of Events Committee members suggested June 4 for the dinner with the senior class. It was requested that the June and July meetings be changed due to conflicts with the dates. A motion (Padien, Hall) to move the June meeting from the 18th to the 11th carried with a vote of 4-0. A motion (Padien, Hall) to move the July meeting from the 16th to the 23rd carried with a vote of 4-0. Adjournment A motion (Padien, Doyle) at 8:40 p.m. to adjourn carried with a vote of 4-0. Marsha L. Gutierrez, Clerk Date approved: June 11, 2012"

      "Minutes of the Meeting",
      "A Study Commission meeting was held in Room 313 of the State House, 82 Smith Street, Providence, Rhode Island on Monday, May 21, 2012. Rosemary Booth Gallogly, Director of Revenue and Chairperson of the Pension Study Commission called the meeting to order at 1:10 pm. Commission members present: Rosemary Booth Gallogly, Jean Bouchard, Paul Doughty, Allan Fung, Dennis Hoyle, J. Michael Lenihan, Antonio Pires, Joseph Polisena, Steven St. Pierre, Mark Dingley representing Gina Raimondo and John Simmons Members absent: Bruce Keiser, Richard Licht and Angel Taveras Others present: Susanne Greschner, Chief of the Division of Municipal Finance, Daniel Sherman from Sherman Actuarial Services, LLC and members of the public Agenda Item # 1 \u2013 Approval of Minutes from May 7, 2012 For the first item on the agenda Chairperson Booth Gallogly asked if the Commission members had any corrections, adjustments or additions to the draft minutes provided from the Study Commission meeting held on May 7, 2012. There were none. Mayor Polisena from the Town of Johnston made a motion to accept the minutes as written. The motion was seconded by Tony Pires, Director of Administration from the City of Pawtucket. The motion passed all in favor. Agenda Item # 2 \u2013 Actuarial Valuations and Experience Studies, Next Steps \u2013 Attachments B & C Next on the agenda, Chairperson Booth Gallogly informed the Commission that Dan Sherman from Sherman Actuarial Services, LLC has grouped locally-administered pension plans into tiers and Susanne Greschner, chief of the Division of Municipal Finance developed an explanation on what the tiers mean. She introduced Ms. Greschner and Mr. Sherman to review their findings. Ms. Greschner indicated that the letter to municipalities and attached tiers found in attachments B and C of the addendum were developed in an effort to identify where communities stand and to provide guidance to the municipalities. She referred the Commission members to the attachments and reviewed the tiers with them. She indicated that the tiers were a work in progress and that she wanted to send the letters to the municipalities to provide guidance and seek feedback in order to update the tiers as necessary. Therefore, the goal for the meeting was to approve the letter so that it could be mailed out to municipalities. Ms. Greschner indicated that based on what has been submitted to date certain communities (tiers 3, 6, 7 & 8) either did not conduct or had an incomplete experience study. She also referred to the attached letter from Little Compton regarding this matter (see addendum). The question was posed to the",
      "Page 2 of 5",
      "Commission if these communities should have to submit an experience study given that, in some cases, they had a very high funded ratio or a very small pension plan. Mr. Sherman raised the point that requiring an experience study to be done for communities with a small number of pension plan beneficiaries might not lead to accurate results due to the small number of participants. Chairperson Booth Gallogly suggested that Mr. Sherman could talk to the actuaries of the communities with the outstanding experience studies to help facilitate the process. The topic of pension plan amortization was raised and Mayor Fung from the City of Cranston asked Mr. Sherman to explain the difference between a 30 year rolling amortization and a 30 year closed amortization. Mr. Sherman replied that a 30 year closed amortization plan is like a 30 year mortgage in that you pay year after year and the unfunded liability decreases. In a 30 year rolling amortization plan, it takes a lot longer to get rid of the unfunded liability because you continually spread the unfunded liability over 30 years rather than reducing the timeframe as the years pass. This results in an annual required contribution (ARC) that is lower than in a closed amortization plan because you always spread the liability out over 30 years instead of reducing the time period. On another note, Chairperson Booth Gallogly stated that she has received several notices of critical status from administrators of locally-administered pension plans which have a funded ratio of less than 60%. She noted that it is the responsibility of pension plan administrators to mail such notification. Mr. Pires inquired about how much communication there will be between the Department of Revenue and a city or town before the alternative funding improvement plan is complete. Chairperson Booth Gallogly replied that she would have to think about that. Next, Ms. Greschner introduced Steve Woerner, the finance director from the Town of Cumberland to address the Commission regarding the town\u2019s experience study and actuarial valuation. Mr. Woerner indicated that the Town of Cumberland believes its pension plan, with only 40 active members, is too small to conduct an accurate experience study. Instead of hiring an actuary to perform an experience study, Mr. Woerner explained that the town\u2019s pension board decided it would drop its assumed investment rate on plan assets from 8% to 7.5%. In addition, they decided to adopt the mortality assumptions used for the state police. They spoke to their actuary about this as well as their unions who agreed to it. Therefore, he doesn\u2019t understand the need to spend the money for a full experience study. Chairperson Booth Gallogly noted that the purpose of the experience study is to see if the assumptions used are still accurate on a go-forward basis. She asked Mr. Sherman if he wanted to comment on the number of participants in a plan. Mr. Sherman replied that when a plan has so few people it calls into question the validity of the results. He added that plans usually get into critical status due to a lack of contributions or a 30 year rolling amortization rather than incorrect assumptions. Mr. Pires inquired if the Commission could recommend to the legislature that an experience study could be waived if a city or town adopted the state\u2019s assumptions. Chairperson Booth Gallogly noted that while she agreed with the concept she was concerned that the disability process and, therefore, occurrences could be very different between the state and locally-administered plans. Paul Doughty, President of Providence\u2019s Local 1651 Firefighters union, expressed concern over what he called a laissez faire response to Cumberland\u2019s lack of submission of its experience study and actuarial valuation and wanted to know if there was a reason why the town had not submitted one. Mr.",
      "Page 3 of 5",
      "Woerner responded that the town is in the process of negotiating with its unions, therefore, the actuarial valuation will change significantly. Regarding the critical status of Cumberland\u2019s pension plan, Mr. Woerner noted that the critical status is due to prior administrations not funding the pension. He added that the town has funded its ARC every year since Mayor McKee has taken office in 2000 with the exception of the fiscal year 2011 when the state\u2019s motor vehicle excise tax reimbursement was cut and this year when it was only funded at 85%. He indicated that the town is planning to fully fund its ARC in the upcoming fiscal year and that they have a plan to get out of critical status within the next 1 \u00bd to 2 years. He added that Moody\u2019s most recent review said the town was being \u201cproactive\u201d. The issue of whether or not to require these communities to incur the cost of the experience study was debated by the Commission with the end result being that the Rhode Island General Law statute \u00a745-65-6 requires all locally-administered pension plans to submit an experience study and actuarial valuation to the Commission. Therefore, the Commission does not feel it has the authority to grant any exemptions. Lastly, the Commission addressed the section of the proposed letter to municipalities regarding reimbursement of the actuarial valuation. Mayor Fung felt that the State did not have authority under the law to require that only communities that adopted some or all of the results of their experience study would be reimbursed. Chairperson Booth Gallogly noted that she did not disagree with Mayor Fung, however, she was hoping to incentivize communities to comply with the request to provide the Commission with the information it needs by delaying payment until the information is received. Mayor Fung reiterated that the Commission cannot go beyond the provisions of the law and that the ability to withhold state aid should be used as the incentive. Therefore, the Commission agreed to delete the language in the letter which indicated that reimbursement would only be made to certain communities that have complied at this time. For clarification, Mr. Greschner noted that she has received some invoices for experience studies as well as the actuarial valuation, however, per RIGL \u00a745-65-6 (3) reimbursement pertains to the actuarial valuation only. A motion was made by Mayor Fung from the City of Cranston to approve the letter to be sent to municipalities with the changes discussed. The motion was seconded by Mayor Polisena. The motion passed all in favor. Agenda Item # 3 \u2013 Funding Improvement Plan Requirements \u2013 Attachments D & E Chairperson Booth Gallogly explained that she felt it is important to set some standards in determining the \u201creasonableness of the alternative funding improvement plans\u201d, and that the Commission may want to provide guidance. She asked for the Commission members\u2019 thoughts on telling communities what to submit. Ms. Greschner reinforced what the Chairperson said by adding that the purpose of Attachment D (see addendum) is to provide guidance to cities and towns since the law does not give specific guidance. Mayor Fung stated that he does not see the Commission\u2019s role as approving these alternative funding improvement plans. Chairperson Booth Gallogly responded that it is important that someone, be it the tax payers, general assembly, or the Study Commission, have good documentation to determine if the funding improvement plans are reasonable. Mayor Fung replied that he is OK with the first part of attachment D which lists the documentation required, but has concerns about the second part. For example, how would the Commission determine what is reasonable and what is not?",
      "Page 4 of 5",
      "Chairperson Booth Gallogly suggested that the Commission take a look at the table Ms. Greschner put together which looks at a possible solution for funding improvement. As such, she referred everyone to attachment E and asked Ms. Greschner and Mr. Sherman to walk the Commission through the table. Ms. Greschner explained that she applied the recently enacted Pension Protection Act calculations to the locally-administered pension plans and modified it to see what the funded ratio might be after 15 years. Based on these calculations, it became clear that we had to look at alternative rules. Mr. Sherman noted that the rules he would impose to get a plan out of critical status would be first to fully fund the ARC by either funding at 100% or by changing the benefit structure and, second would be to shorten the amortization period. He added that using a 25 year amortization period made sense because it would get the plan to 60% funded more rapidly. Mr. Sherman indicated that a lot of locally-administered plans are not even paying their pay-as-you-go expense. For example, Providence has not fully funded its pay-as-you-go and is approximately $15 million short. Therefore, the city needs to pay significantly more than its ARC just to cover its pay-as-you-go costs. Mayor Fung asked Mr. Sherman to explain this further. Mr. Sherman responded that if a plan has many retirees with a 15 year life expectancy but the plan has a 30 year amortization period then the plan would owe more than a 30 year amortization would indicate. Mayor Fung stated that he is worried that it might not be wise to cap plan recoveries at 15 years per the Pension Protection Act calculation. He wouldn\u2019t want to cut the benefits so much that it is unfair to the retirees nor does he want to hurt the tax payers. Chairperson Booth Gallogly asked what a reasonable timeframe is. Adding, \u201cshould it be different depending on a plan\u2019s funded ratio?\u201d She does not want to make this too burdensome, however, she also does not want cities and towns to continue to kick the can down the road. Mr. Sherman responded that 15 years is reasonable for plans that are 40 \u2013 50% funded. However, 20 years would be more reasonable for plans that are 20-30% funded because if you go beyond that, then you just keep pushing the cost of benefits onto future generations that did not benefit from the services in the first place. John Simmons, executive director from the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council, asked if Mr. Sherman could provide the Commission with some further analysis. Mr. Sherman indicated that he would. Mayor Fung asked that attachment E be updated with more current data. Ms. Greschner responded that the Division of Municipal Finance and the Auditor General\u2019s Office are working on this and will provide an updated analysis. Agenda Item # 4 \u2013 Public Comments Peder Schaefer, associate director from the League of Cities and Towns asked if it would be ok to send a letter to the Commission with his comments about today\u2019s meeting. Chairperson Booth Gallogly indicated that it would and his letter is provided in the addendum. Chairperson Booth Gallogly also noted that the League of Cities and Towns will be hosting a fiduciary responsibility seminar for trustees and members of municipal pension boards on Monday, June 11, 2012 from 4:00 \u2013 5:30 PM at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Warwick, RI. The event will also be recorded and broadcast on Capitol TV (schedule unknown at this time). She indicated that it is a great opportunity and encourages many to take advantage of this.",

      "I. Call to Order -\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090 Patrick Tigue and Kim Paull from the Office of the Health Insurance Committee",
      "II. Presentation (available upon request, and located on website) Questions/Comments/Clarifications",
      "a. Domenic Delmonico: What I have been confused about, how does expectation of a four percent maximum medical expense trend factor line up with regulation 2? Does this pre-\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090empt regulation 2?",
      "i. Patrick Tigue: Regulation two was proposed last year, but as it was introduced last year it was never approved. This in no way, at this stage, pre-\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090empts regulation two however \u2013 this dos not have the force in the way that the existing regulation 2 stands.",
      "b. Vivian Weissman: As this is happening, is there any look at whether small groups are actually leaving and not renewing? I hear anecdotally that a number of small groups find it unaffordable already and are starting to leave.",
      "i. Patrick Tigue: We are working to report on market enrollment on a frequent basis.",
      "ii. Kim Paull: The big trend we saw in this enrolment is that the insurance market increased \u2013 we added about 4,256 covered lives to the privately enrolled market. The caveat is those are mostly self-\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090insured.",
      "iii. Stacy Paterno: When you look at that number and say self-\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090insured, do we know that those would be the folks who are eligible now as a result of the ACA, or those who are just walking in -\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090 was there a corresponding drop in other markets.",
      "iv. Kim Paull: Overall RI population is falling, so both sides of the equation are decreasing. You have slightly more in the privately insured market.",
      "v. Patrick Tigue: I think that on a data level we are not able to tease out how many were from growth in the market through the ACA vs. just natural growth.",
      "vi. Kim Paull: It is difficult to draw causation from the trends, but we do look at the trend of large group number of lives, and self-\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090",
      "insured lives, and for the first time, self-\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090insured lives outnumber large group.",
      "c. Domenic Delmonico: One thing w haven\u2019t seen is the linkage o this work to the public health goals and the real job for the people in these rooms are improving public health \u2013 where can we find that connection. It doesn\u2019t seem like that linkage is there.",
      "i. Kim Paull: That is a great point and that is not lost on us at all \u2013 I believe that at the last meeting of coordinated health planning council it was said that if we do the job right the numbers will reflect it, but we need the numbers to show where we are. Our goal as an office is to provide tools, to start the conversations and partner with the Dept of Health and others to find that connection.",
      "ii. Patrick Tigue: It is not lost on us at all, and now that we have additional staff capacity, working on alignment against other state agencies is a key goal and working with health, and while recognizing what Kim said that we have individual purviews on this, working to affect public health.",
      "iii. Domenic Delmonico: It is tough to consider monetary changes, but the consideration is what are you doing to public health goals.",
      "iv. Patrick Tigue: You are right we will eventually have to see if we are going to put our money where our mouths are.",
      "d. Joan Kwiatkowski: Are all of these relative to all populations? Or are you simply looking at adult insured populations in this data?",
      "i. Kim Paull: For our hospital payment study (first two), those are the claims that are coming in from the hospitals, and we are working with the insurance partners for that data, so it is insured lives. One other consideration we are reviewing is what does it mean to be uninsured in RI. To answer your questions it is who is insured by one of the big three in Rhode Island.",
      "e. Tilak Verma: These things that you are proposing to measure in the future, it seems to me that it has been done in the past and is accessible somewhere perhaps?",
      "i. Kim Paull: That\u2019s true, and we do struggle with how do we bring something new to the conversation. For example the PPR study \u2013 Medicare does a PPR study, but only for Medicare patients \u2013 this will be overall, expanding the conversation. Also it is updated, so that we know now what are working with and what our environment looks like now.",
      "III. Questions & Discussion a. Stacy Paterno: Can you speak to a hearing that was held the other day",
      "on affordability standards?",
      "i. Patrick Tigue: The fourth affordability standard is one that requires issuers to work toward comprehensive payment reform across the delivery system. There are six conditions that have to be met to meet reviews. There was a public input meeting (not a hearing) last week, and with that as the spurring and animating idea for tit are these the right kind of conditions for this, if we are to reverse them what you would prefer to see in them, what would you like left out. The response was not quite what we were looking for, but we will extend the deadline by about a week to see if anyone else would like to weigh in. We will take it all into account, publish the comment etc.",
      "b. Stacy Paterno: Since you put the original provision in place in 2010, what have you seen happen and what is prompting the next level?",
      "i. Patrick Tigue: If you look at the Affordability assessment published back in November, generally speaking we have seen a large degree of compliance and all have had some success in moving things forward. We have seen it move from per diem to more efficient services and payment models, we do think they have moved things in the right direction, broadly speaking, but we believe there is always room for improvement.",
      "c. Domenic Delmonico: As you move towards more risk models, RI balance sheets of those companies are very week. Somehow the insurance commissioner needs to step in, for that transfer of risk eventually will fall to providers. There is very little activity that identifies the person taking on the risk or the company taking on the risk. The movement of self-\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090funding is very concerning, and if you as regulators do not step in it is a concern. Secondly, as providers move to bundled payments and capitation, balance sheets in RI don\u2019t support what is underlying those moves and that will be a concern.",
      "i. Patrick Tigue: One the first issue, more employers even some smaller groups moving towards a self insured arrangement, there is acknowledgement that is happening and certainly concerning for the issues you are pointing out. There are regulatory limits to what we can do due to ERISA. I understand that it is a very real concern and that we are commitment to doing whatever is in our purview to do what is in our regulatory flexibility to prepare and work on how to address that going forward. On the provider side, we again do not have direct regulatory flexibility on that issue. We want to reform the system in a way that is quick but not unrealistic and not damaging. This is why we do want to hear from you.",
      "d. Kim Paull: This is not an immediate transition, describing weight points so that both sides of the equation can help make those changes",
      "so that folks on both sides of those conversations can be on the same page. We want to motivate discussions about what will work for you.",
      "IV. Public Comment \u2013 No additional comment given at this time.",
      "V. Adjourn \u2013 Please reach out to Kim or Patrick at any time with questions, concerns and input."

      "Motion: Tim made a motion to approve the minutes with the corrections noted. Second: George seconded the motion. Discussion: There was no discussion. Vote: All who were in attendance at the meeting April 24th voted in favor of the motion. Norweco, Inc. Technology Application for Singulair 960 TNT and Singulair Green 960 TNT for nitrogen removal The application is for a Class One approval, but the material submitted does not fulfill the requirements for Class Two, nor does it fulfill the requirements for a Class Two application. However, the proposed OWTS Rules on which a public hearing was held May 3rd, are expected to be promulgated with Rule 37.4 as-proposed. The proposed Rule change accommodates submission of a NSF/ANSI Standard 245 Report with a preponderance of the effluent TN concentrations less than 19 mg/data, to fulfill the data and approvals element of a Class Two nitrogen removal application. Deb sent Don Bach, a letter May 3rd explaining this and identifying additional information that needs to be submitted even with consideration of the simplified application process that would be afforded by promulgation of Rule 37.4 as proposed. Don Bach of Norweco, Inc. distributed bound material titled \u201c\"Rhode Island Application: Singulair Model 960 TNT and Singulair Green Model 960 TNT for Nitrogen Removal\", dated May 22, 2012. He explained that Norweco, Inc. is requesting a nitrogen removal approval from RI for Singulair 960 TNT and Singulair Green 960 TNT, based on the anticipated new Rules. He understands that there is some risk that the Rule might not be promulgated as-proposed and that if this is the case, he understands that his application and today\u2019s presentation is lacking. The state approvals that were not provided with the first application that was sent to RI in two installments in April are included in the material distributed this morning. He explained that the data from Maryland were provided by a third party, Chesapeake Labs, Inc. in Maryland, which is certified by the USEPA.",

      "He explained that Singulair TNT (both concrete and plastic) use only one pump, therefore it is less costly to purchase and to operate than other nitrogen removal systems that require recirculation of effluent to denitrify; Singulair TNT uses a 60-minute on and 60-minute off non-adjustable aeration setting to denitrify. Russ asked Don if Norweco obtains RI approval for nitrogen removal for the 960 TNT, what would happen to the existing approval issued to Siegmund Environmental, Inc. (SESI), for nitrogen removal. Don responded that there would be two different RI Singulair nitrogen removal approvals. Deb recalled however, at the TRC meeting last September attended by both Don and Hollister Siegmund of SESI, when Hollister was asked if he would withdraw the SESI nitrogen removal approval if Norweco obtained RI approval for Singulair TNT, he replied that he would. The distinction between the two systems is that the SESI system recirculates the effluent and the Norweco TNT uses a 60-minute on and 60-minute off aeration setting to accomplish nitrogen removal. Russ asked Don to speak with Hollister about this. Don agreed to do so and stated that Hollister is aware of Don\u2019s attending the meeting today and is supportive of his purpose. Russ was not able to find an approval letter from Massachusetts Department of Environmental protection (MADEP) in the material Don provided this morning, although he did find a letter from MADEP dated December 9, 2010 confirming receipt of an application from Norweco, Inc. requesting a modification of the existing Remedial Use approval with the addition of Singulair Green TNT. Don wasn\u2019t able to state with certainty if a letter granting the requested modification to the Remedial Use approval had been received. Russ explained that a MADEP Remedial Use approval authorizes installation of the subject system for repairs only and not for new construction. Russ asked if Singulair TNT is approved in Maryland because he couldn\u2019t find a letter of approval from Maryland in the application material. Don stated that it is. Russ asked Don to follow-up by providing approval letters that were not included in the application material provided this morning. Don agreed to do this. Brian Moore asked about the relationship between Norweco, Inc. and Siegmund Environmental Services, Inc. and an explanation of the company\u2019s policy authorizing distribution Norweco Singulair treatment systems. Brian explained that DEM had received a letter from SESI concerning the sale of a Singulair Green unit by an entity other than SESI. Don stated that SESI is Norweco, Inc.\u2019s RI distributor and Bob Frost is their CT distributor, but that US law prohibits a vendor from stating where a distributor may sell the product. He explained that such competition between distributors can result in a lower cost to the customer. Norweco, Inc. does require that distributors service what they sell and if a distributor goes out of business, or dies, Norweco, Inc. will be responsible for that distributor\u2019s systems and will provide a qualified service provider to service the systems. He explained that service providers are trained by the distributors who provide a certificate acknowledging the training. Service provider training is also available generally monthly, at the Norweco factory in Ohio, at no cost, following which a certificate is also issued. It was not known if the system sold by Mr. Frost was for TSS and BOD reduction (this certification is issued to Norweco, Inc. as the vendor and names SESI as exclusive distributor), or for nitrogen removal, which is issued to SESI as vendor and distributor, with no use of the term \u201cexclusive distributor\u201d, but cites Hollister Siegmund, company president, as the contact). Russ stated that regardless of the type of Singulair system (TSS & BOD, or N-removal) purchased from Mr. Frost and regardless of whether the exclusivity of another distributorship was violated, SESI has a responsibility to train and approve installers and designers and a primary question to be answered is was Mr. Frost authorized to install the system. Deb couldn\u2019t remember if she had seen his name on any of the training rosters from SESI, but she will look this up. (Post meeting follow-up: Robert Frost and Robert Frost, Jr. who is the installer of record for the subject system both attended Singulair training offered by SESI January 18, 2012 and the repair application was received at RIDEM in February 2012). Don stated that while competition can benefit the consumer, he is concerned about conflict between distributors but that he has no legal authority to resolve it or to restrict their marketing and sales activities by geographic location and this is an issue between Mr. Frost and SESI and he understands and accepts RIDEM\u2019s statement that regulating distribution of technologies they approve is not with in their authority. Brian Moore asked exactly what Norweco, Inc. does control. Don responded: training, service, maintenance, and the quality of these activities and the record keeping of the distributors and service providers. Don explained that NSF requires that vendors of systems certified to standards 40 and 245, to maintain listing as such, audit 10% of their distributors of NSF certified systems annually. NSF audits about 2.5% of distributors of certified products. Once annually, Norweco goes out and does a structured NSF audit to an NSF protocol. They account for what is installed and where. They review files and visit three installed systems. They are required to report to NSF, any non-compliance item as written on the NSF form. Norweco has a commercial contract with each of their distributors, all of which are factory trained. Norweco may cancel these commercial contracts if there are complaints from homeowners or regulatory agencies, about a distributor not performing as they should. Deb asked if Norweco, Inc. obtains a nitrogen removal approval for Singulair TNT in RI, would they agree to not including the term \u201cexclusive\u201d distributor on the certification? Don responded that they would. He explained that he thought that listing exclusive distributors was standard practice in RI and that he didn\u2019t intend or expect this to cause any",
      "APPROVED Minutes_5-22-12.doc Page 3 of 5",
      "problems. Deb explained that use of the term \u201cexclusive\u201d is a deviation from the practice of listing distributors or local contacts on certifications and this is why she was insistent on getting this request from Norweco, Inc. and agreement to it from SESI, in writing. There was some discussion about why there would be a CT distributor for Singulair since CT Department of Public Health (CTDPH) hasn\u2019t issued state approvals for alternative treatment systems. While they allow alternative systems to be used on a town-by-town basis as approved by the local departments of health, no system installations have been approved by the towns, so there is a CT distributor in place with no practical market in CT. Don explained that they are prepared to serve Old Saybrook when that town implements a program allowing alternative onsite wastewater treatment. Brian Moore explained to Don that with more than one distributor, issues associated with the certifications\u2019 requirements for reporting to RIDEM are more complicated and he wanted Don to be aware of the responsibility as vendor to ensure distributor compliance with RIDEM certification requirements. He also expressed concern about continuity of service for the systems into the future when current service contracts expire: will each of the distributors be willing to service systems sold by the competitor? He also asked about additional service providers: are there others, who are they and if there are not, who will train them? Don explained that the purchase of any NSF Standard 40 system includes four service visits, delivered as two visits each year for the first two years of ownership. After this first two-year interval, all distributors are obligated to offer a service contract under their commercial contract with Norweco, Inc. After two years, he expects that both distributors will be mailing homeowners seeking the service contract and there may be competition between the two entities. Don agreed that in issues of competition and conflict, he, not DEM would fulfill the role of referee. George asked Don to describe the treatment train of the Maryland systems for which the data were provided and from where were the influent and effluent samples obtained. Don explained that there is a sampling box installed before the first compartment. Don explained that systems can be installed with a telemetry option that notifies the service provider, or even to the regulatory agency, of alarm conditions by telephone or internet. He asked if this is something that we may see value in. Deb explained that Laszlo (Siegmund, of SESI) had explained the telemetry option, but if telemetry is not required of all treatment systems approved in RI, he didn\u2019t want to request that it be required with the Singulair system and therefore telemetry is currently an option with Singulair in RI and not a requirement. Russ explained to Don that although Norweco, Inc.\u2019s application to RI for a nitrogen removal approval for Singulair TNT cites 68% removal, RI recognizes two categories of nitrogen removal approvals, 50%, with treated effluent TN concentrations of 19 mg/L or less, and 75%, with treated effluent TN concentrations of 10 mg/L or less. So, we will be evaluating the technology under the 50% TN removal standard and not the 68% TN removal claimed in the application. Don explained that 68% is the TN removal cited in the NSF 245 report and that is why Norweco cites this, but he did not object to the RI 50%. Proposed Regulatory Changes to Address Concerns of South County Towns Russ reported that the public hearing for the proposed OWTS Rules was held as scheduled on Thursday, May 3rd and that DEM is considering the comments that were received on these proposed Rules. No comments were received from South Kingstown or Westerly. But Charlestown submitted comments, which were to see the attached comments submitted by Dave Potts of GeoMatrix, LLC. Some of these comments were not applicable because they were addressing issues in an earlier version of the draft Rules and not the version that was issued for public notice. So, DEM needs to talk with Charlestown about this, in case the Rule change, as it was ultimately proposed for public notice is not consistent with what they want to see as a result of the process. An issue in Dave Potts\u2019s comments is the proposed experimental technology application and requiring three systems at a minimum. Our objective for approving use of a technology under the experimental review process is to better understand how a system performs under actual use conditions. While three may be criticized as too few, it is a better data set for consideration of system performance than a single installation, or even two of them. It isn\u2019t clear why Charlestown would agree with reducing the number of installations authorized under the experimental application to one, because of the number of homes in their town that are in need of upgrade under the municipal cesspool phase-out and this process wouldn\u2019t contribute to the solution of quickly providing a more economical nitrogen removal option for these residents. The original purpose of the experimental technology application option was to provide an opportunity to vendors of a new technology for which they did not have the required approvals and performance data for a Class Two approval, but for which there was enough information available to suggest that the system should perform to the RI standard and the vendor\u2019s claim. It was expected that these vendors would monitor these systems and compile performance data with the objective of obtaining the necessary support for a RIDEM Class Two approval. The requirement for proposing three to ten sites at which to install the subject system is an important element of the experimental technology review process and",

      "Russ prefers to retain this part of the rule as written and not allow an experimental system to be installed and evaluated at any less than three sites. Russ stated that DEM wants to review this with Charlestown and explain why DEM doesn\u2019t want to make this change to the experimental technology application process. Russ reported that DEM also received a letter from Orenco Systems, Inc. (OSI). They object to allowing NSF/ANSI Standard 245 as proposed, because the influent nitrogen in the test is low and it is therefore easy to achieve the required 50% total nitrogen removal and treated effluent total nitrogen concentration of 19 mg/L or less. Since the group had before them the Standard 245 report for Singulair TNT, the influent total nitrogen concentrations were reviewed: the maximum was reported as 58 mg/L; the minimum was 15 mg/L with a standard deviation of 10. The alkalinity is reported as 310 mg/L. With that alkalinity concentration and influent total nitrogen of 38 mg/L the system\u2019s ability to nitrify is not limited by alkalinity and it is therefore easy under these conditions for a system to achieve the required total nitrogen treatment objective of 50% removal. However, in some observations, the total nitrogen concentrations were higher than 38 mg/L and the total nitrogen removal was better than 50%, for example influent TN of 56 mg/L and effluent TN of 10 mg/L . The Maryland raw influent TN concentration data ranges from 10.1 mg/L to 254mg/L (which may be sampling error). 50\u2019s, 60\u2019s or up to 70\u2019s (expressed in mg/L TN) typify the normal residential wastewater influent. There are 31 sample events, 55 overall and 58% of the time they exceeded 50% TN removal. There are only three systems in this group with an average of 19 mg/L total nitrogen in the treated effluent. George doesn\u2019t think that the Maryland data support NSF standard 245 report data for the Singulair TNT. However, the unusually high influent strengths could be the result of sampling error: if a sample is collected with a small chunk of solids in it, when it is shaken at the lab before the analytical test or tests are performed, that bit of solid will result in higher concentrations of some of the test parameters. This may have been the cause of the high concentrations in the set of results from Maryland, because generally the results don\u2019t look bad. Flow data for the Maryland systems would have helped us better understand their performance results. A Massachusetts provisional approval requires that 90% of the time a system is meeting the standard. In RI we haven\u2019t set a percent of systems\u2019 data that must meet our requirement of 50% reduction of total nitrogen and 19 mg/L in treated effluent, we look at the average for each system. There was some discussion of the report from Barnstable, MA, \u201cPerformance of Innovative Alternative Onsite Septic Systems For The Removal Of Nitrogen in Barnstable County, Massachusetts 1999-2007\u201d which reported that nitrogen removal systems are only treating to the MADEP regulatory limit of 19 mg/L 50% of the time. Noel asked about considering development of a loading-based requirement, which would acknowledge that low flow uses will produce a more concentrated effluent, rather than the current standard which requires that a set concentration be produced. Russ agreed that we should have a discussion on this. Noel suggested that under the experimental application we require at least three systems to be installed, and that these three proposed sites should be identified as part of the application, but that we could give them some time between installations, perhaps 90-days, and that we accommodate minor modifications to the system that could result in improved performance. This met mixed review: what if a vendor walks away before all three are installed and how much modification would be considered minor? And, if this worked ideally, it could result in a better system than that which was initially proposed. Russ asked if anyone had any questions about the Rule change. No one had any questions, but George wanted some additional discussion about NSF 245 influent waste strength and approving systems that demonstrate compliance with the RI regulatory standard on the basis of this testing and certification. He\u2019s been dealing with the issue of low influent strength and its impact on interpretation of testing results since the mid 1980\u2019s, when it was proposed that effluent from a lift station in SK at URI would be used for a testing protocol (at what is now the NEOWTC); reviewers claimed the waste strength was too low for the proposed testing to yield results that would be indicative of performance under actual use conditions. Municipal strength wastewater is known to be lower than that which is produced at a typical home. To remediate this issue, URI researchers amended the influent waste strength. A nutrient pump was used to feed ammonium on a timed basis into the test system influent to increase the total nitrogen from 40 mg/L to about 65 mg/L for the research project. George was one of the reviewers of the Barnstable project for which a nutrient pump is not used; their influent, which is diverted wastewater treatment plant influent is at about 38 mg/L. And although there remains the issue of concentration versus loading, the report from Barnstable does show less than 50% success complying with the MADEP treatment requirement. Russ called everyone\u2019s attention to page 8 of the Norweco Singulair TNT NSF 245 report, where the effluent quality parameters required for the system to successfully pass the Standard 245 evaluation are reported. The average total nitrogen of all effluent samples must be less than 50% of the average total nitrogen concentration of all influent samples.",
      "APPROVED Minutes_5-22-12.doc Page 5 of 5",
      "George explained that with higher nitrogen concentrations there is an \u201calkalinity wall\u201d condition, where available alkalinity is depleted and nitrification will not occur. About 7.5 mg/L alkalinity is required to convert 1 mg/L ammonium to nitrate and fostering nitrification is the hardest step of the nitrogen removal process; denitrification is easily accomplished with low enough oxygen status. Deb distributed three sheets that she developed for review of the systems that have this certification: a list of vendors and their products with Standard 245 certification; a list of the performance criteria for Standards 40 and 245; and a summary of the first four of the 245 certified products\u2019 TN data (only four were included because of time constraints). There are 11 vendors (reported as of October 27, 2011 when she prepared this list) and 62 individual products among them (in many cases, these are different sizes of a treatment system). Two of these vendors\u2019 systems have nitrogen removal approvals in RI. TN influent data (mg/L) for the four technologies summarized range from 29 to 52, 26 to 55, 30 to 61 and 29 to 98, with averages (mg/L) of 39, 43, 44 and 43. Effluent ranges (mg/L): 8.6 to 23, 2.6 to 31, 6.8 to 36 and 2.2 to 50, with averages (mg/L) of 16, 9, 18 and 8.9. Adjournment and Next Meeting Because of the lateness of the hour, it was agreed that we would postpone the large AE system compliance update until the next meeting. The next meeting was scheduled for June 28th, pending availability of a meeting venue and the meeting adjourned.",

In addition, Runway 16-34 safety enhancements will require a partial relocation of Airport Road 100 feet north of the current intersection with Post Road to accommodate the installation of engineered materials arresting system (EMAS). EMAS will also be installed at the Runway 5 end to reduce the degree of relocation needed for Main Avenue. The safety improvements to Runway 34 end, which include EMAS, necessitate the placement of fill material into approximately 5.0 acres of freshwater wetlands that form the headwaters of Buckeye Brook. The proposed wetland fill activity triggers both federal (USACE) and state (RIDEM) wetland permit requirements. Located at 2000 Post Road, Warwick, Rhode Island.",

      "each slide in detail. The topics Mr. Wood discussed included a brief",
      "history of the GKP and its members and how the group was formed.",
      "Next Mr. Wood discussed the slides and explained ideas for",
      "transforming Kennedy Plaza and the surrounding area into a",
      "welcoming space with markets and food trucks, festivals and major",
      "events, music, art installations, and children\u2019s and family",
      "programming. He elaborated on the economic impacts of improving",
      "the space and showed slides with examples from other city parks and",

      "safety, gathering places, commerce and recreation.",
      "Mr. Baudouin spoke next and said RIPTA has been a good partner",
      "and that the quality of Kennedy Plaza and the space around it is very",
      "important to economic development in downtown Providence. He",
      "said that recreating Kennedy Plaza gives the state an opportunity to",
      "bring itself up a level.",
      "The Board members applauded the Greater Kennedy Plaza Groups",
      "initiative and thanked Mr. Wood and Mr. Baudouin for their",
      "presentation.",
      "Agenda Item 3: Public Comment",
      "Mayor Avedisian recognized ATU Vice President Tom Cute who said",
      "he was speaking on behalf of ATUI President Paul Harrington who",
      "chose not to attend today\u2019s Board meeting in protest of what he",
      "termed the audacity of the CEO to accept a raise in pay which he",
      "alleged was a violation of his employment contract. Mr. Cute then",
      "read a letter into the record on behalf of Mr. Harrington. That letter is",
      "attached hereto as Exhibit A.",
      "Don Rhodes of the RIPTA Riders group spoke next and said that",
      "House Bill 7810 which was heard at the State House last week",
      "received a great deal of support and he was encouraged by this. Mr.",
      "Rhodes said he supports House Bill 7810 because RIPTA is shrinking",
      "and this helps no one.",
      "Board member Maureen Martin stated she had questions regarding",
      "the CEO raise and asked if she would be allowed time in executive",
      "session to address this issue. Mayor Avedisian said she would.",
      "Agenda Item 4: Chief Executive Officer\u2019s Report",
      "Charles Odimgbe began his report by asking if the Board had any",
      "questions on the E-Team or ATMS reports that had been given to the",
      "Board. He noted that this month\u2019s ATMS report was unchanged.",
      "There were no questions.",
      "Next Mr. Odimgbe gave a report on a trip to Memphis by RIPTA staff.",
      "He said staff had traveled to a Memphis transit facility to look at a",
      "system installed by ACS, our ATMS provider, to observe the system",
      "in action and ask questions. He said the trip went very well.",
      "The CEO said that the hearings on House Bill 7581 were very well",
      "attended which was encouraging, but he is not sure what the",
      "recommendation will ultimately be. He said last year after many,",
      "many meetings and hearings RIPTA was yet again unfunded which",
      "led to cuts. The CEO described some of the many initiatives he has",
      "undertaken over the past 17 months to cut costs and find efficiencies",
      "and these actions lowered the deficit but there are really no more",
      "efficiencies to be had and any more cuts will hurt the system and",
      "service. Mr. Odimgbe said the Board needs to begin a dialog on how",
      "to continue providing service next year if there is no funding. The",
      "CEO has been discussing the deficit for 17 months and we are",
      "approaching the point where we will be forced to deficit spend if we",
      "are not funded, but we can only deficit spend for a few months before",
      "we begin to experience cash flow problems.",
      "Mr. Odimgbe then reported on the Comprehensive Operational",
      "Analysis (SOA) and said Phase I is almost complete. A technical",
      "advisory committee is being formed to analyze the results. The",
      "committee will be comprised of staff and Board members, and he is",
      "reaching out to the House and Senate to ask for appointees to serve.",
      "Regarding the KPI\u2019s for customer complaints it was reported that due",
      "to the more cost effective way we are providing RIde service using",
      "Reveal Software, more passengers are being scheduled per vehicle",
      "causing them to be on the bus longer. This inevitably has led to",
      "higher customer complaints, but it is unavoidable if we are to provide",
      "service at a lower cost. Additionally, prior to using the Reveal",
      "Software, not all customer complaints got logged. The software has",
      "remedied this which is another reason why the complaint percentage",
      "has risen. By next year we will be able to track customer complaints",
      "by agent and operator.",
      "Agenda Item 5: RFP 12-20 Cleaning Chemicals",
      "Roger Mencarini addressed the Board to discuss the agenda item for",
      "FFP 12-20 Cleaning Chemicals. Mr. Mencarini said the RIPTA Board",
      "is asked to award a contract to ChemStation New England of South",
      "Windsor, CT to supply and deliver cleaning chemicals. This is a",
      "three-year contract with up to two annual renewals options to be",
      "exercised at the discretion of the Authority. The estimated cost of the",
      "contract based upon historical usage is $212,692 in the first year and",
      "rising nominally over the next four years.",
      "Following Mr. Mencarini\u2019s remarks Mr. Durkee moved to approve the",
      "award for the supply and delivery of cleaning chemicals to",
      "ChemStation New England as recommended by staff. Mr. Williams",
      "seconded the motion and it passed unanimously.",
      "Agenda Item 6: AD-1207 Comprehensive General Liability Policy and",
      "AD-1206 Comprehensive General Liability Umbrella Policy",
      "John Stanziale and Gary Primavera of Starkweather and Shepley",
      "addressed the Board to discuss staff\u2019s recommendation to obtain",
      "Comprehensive General Liability insurance from Admiral Insurance",
      "Company for the premium cost of $54,895 and Comprehensive",
      "General Liability Umbrella Policy insurance from American",
      "Alternative Insurance at a premium cost of $20,262. Mr. Stanziale said",
      "staff recommends the Authority obtain Comprehensive General",
      "Policy insurance to protect RIPTA from claims arising from negligent",
      "acts on our premises and properties. The CGL policy is for",
      "$1,000,000 per occurrence and $2,000,000 in the aggregate with a",
      "$2,500 deductible. The policy runs 1 year beginning July 1st.",
      "For the CGL Umbrella Policy, the effective date is also July 1st and",
      "for one year. The policy as written provides for coverage of",
      "$4,000,000 per occurrence and a $4,000,000 aggregate in the event of",
      "a significant claim against the Authority and covers claims and legal",
      "expenses. It also provides excess coverage for the underlying CGL",
      "policy purchased to repair RIDOT vehicles. Funding for both is",
      "provided via RIPTA operating funds.",
      "The Mayor and Mr. Williams wondered why four quotes were",
      "declined. Mr. Primavera said our claims experience is not very good,",
      "with a 6% loss rate. He also said the bid was very competitively",
      "priced and the other insurers likely felt it was not worth the money.",
      "Following this discussion the Mayor asked if there were further",
      "questions and hearing none he asked for a motion. Ms. Martin made",
      "a motion to approve the award of the policy for Comprehensive",
      "General Liability Umbrella insurance/AD-1206 to American Alternative",
      "for the premium cost of $20,262. Mr. Williams seconded the motion",
      "which passed unanimously. Next Ms. Martin made a motion to",
      "approve the award of the policy for Comprehensive General Liability",
      "Insurance/AD-1207 with Admiral Insurance at a premium cost of",
      "$54,895. Mr. Williams seconded the motion which passed",

      "thanked Mr. Rhodes for his commitment and said RIPTA is lucky to",

      "NEW BUSINESS: 1. Resolution/Letter Relative to Retiree Healthcare \u2013 C. Roberts/A. McGuire-Forcier Mr. Roberts presented the resolution regarding retiree health care, saying that the WED could realize an estimated $400,000 to $500,000 annually if some revisions are agreed upon. The resolution makes two requests: 1) The retirees match the current medical plan in place through their former collective bargaining unit; and 2) The retirees acknowledge that from this point forward they will be covered by the same medical plan as is in place for the current employees of their former bargaining unit, and that their plan will change with contract changes to always parallel current employees. Upon acceptance of this resolution, the WSC will schedule a \u201ctown hall\u201d type meeting with our retirees, union leadership, insurance broker, etc., to facilitate a discussion regarding the details of the proposed changes. Roberts feels that the WSC\u2019s inaction would be worse for the retirees in the long run, referring to the case with the retiree benefits being slashed in Central Falls when a receiver came in. Motion to approve the resolution: C. Roberts 2nd: No second. Motion dies. \u201cSo this means that no one else on this committee is interested in discussing this issue? No one thinks it\u2019s important to take any steps to structurally change our medical offerings?\u201d asked Mr. Roberts. No further discussion was allowed due to the lack of a second on the motion for discussion.",
      "2. Discussion/Vote to Adopt the FY2013 School Budget: A. McGuire-Forcier, G. Donoyan Ms. Phongsavanh stated that they are still in the process of looking at the budget line-by-line and still have to go through the elementary school line items. Mr. Roberts had about nine items to cover and then would feel comfortable for 1st passage of the budget. Mr. Donlon saw no reason they couldn\u2019t do a first passage this evening. Motion to approve: V. Phongsavanh 2nd: C. Roberts \u2022 Roberts reported that at the last workshop they discussed the amortization of the debt and budgeted $2 million",
      "per year on the advice of the Council President. \u201cIn further talks with the Director of Revenue and Tom Bruce, the net proceeds from the supplemental tax and the remaining tax bills will still leave us at a deficit of about $5 million. Mr. Roberts said Bruce would be more comfortable with a rate of $1 million, but Roberts recommended $1,250,000, unless there are objections.",
      "\u2022 Under the Middle School section, Roberts said they had been asked about a line item of $280,800 under",
      "Professional Education. It was identified as of a couple of hours ago as being for tuitions for St. Mary\u2019s. Mrs. Nadeau thinks it should be moved to the Special Ed line item if it belongs to St. Mary\u2019s. Although he agreed that it\u2019s not in the right place, Roberts thinks it will be confusing enough for the next person who comes in to manage the finances, so he just put a note on it for now.",
      "\u2022 Roberts noted that the budget copy they have now includes the Technology Budget from Jonathan Gallishaw",
      "and his is much more organized so the WSC can see what the funds are being spent on.",
      "\u2022 Roberts pointed out an $85 credit under Coleman\u2019s budget and he recommended they put in $250 so there isn\u2019t an $85 credit there.",
      "\u2022 Roberts noted that there was a question about the E-Learning Director\u2019s salary and where it was in the budget.",
      "They believe it is listed under Assistant Principal of Academy for the WHS. He recommended leaving it in for now. The amount is $89,481.",
      "\u2022 Under Technology and Other, Roberts noted that there is $47,000 for penalties for paying our sewer and water",
      "bills late. Mr. Donlon recommended leaving it in for now because we don\u2019t know the status of all of our vendors.",
      "\u2022 Under the WHS section, the Technology Director has a line item #78 on the digital budget copy for the E-Learning WHS position. Roberts reported that Mr. Gallishaw said that it covers paying for the seats in the E-Learning program for the high school and that 30-seats isn\u2019t enough. \u201cThere are currently 150 students and it\u2019s growing, running 24/7. Mr. Gallishaw suggested doubling that amount. Each $1,000 represents a seat. At 60 seats, the program would still be full,\u201d noted Roberts. Ms. Phongsavanh said she would like it to go to 60 seats",
      "2",
      "WSC Minutes Open Session May 23, 2012",
      "because it\u2019s a growing program and it\u2019s helping the students achieve and get the credits they need. Mr. Roberts feels that it\u2019s providing opportunities for students that might otherwise have to be placed out-of-district. Mr. Donlon felt that 60 seats would be fine.",
      "\u2022 Roberts reported that Mr. Gallishaw couldn\u2019t find a line item for district-wide toner. He estimates about $63,000",
      "for printer toner (not photocopier toner) district-wide. He recommended budgeting between $40,000 and $63,000. Gallishaw said that $63,000 is enough for one cartridge for each printer in the district, but they could probably be able to do with less. They want to find a way to determine who is printing and what they are printing to cut down on the costs. If teachers are printing entire books, it may be cheaper to buy the book. Mr. Roberts requested rounding out the technology budget to $300,000 instead of $251,000.",
      "\u2022 Under Tech and Other, Roberts noted a credit for $86,000 which he recommended deleting because we can\u2019t",
      "count on that coming in. \u201cRIDE is already threatening to eliminate it,\u201d he said. Roberts reported that as of the end of FY12, $207,000 will be been spent for photocopiers. At the last meeting, Mr. Edge commented that that amount was a significant increase as a result of moving from the one middle school building to two buildings. Roberts noted that copiers were purchased with extra bond money for the middle schools. There are now 12 or 14 copiers where there used to be 4 or 5 at the old building. He recommended reducing that estimate to $150,000.",
      "\u2022 Under Revenue, state aid to education, Roberts said he received an email from the City Controller saying that",
      "RIDE has recommended that Woonsocket use a figure of $46,135,013 and Mr. Roberts would like that amount to replace the revenue projection for state aid to education.",

      "then $213,000 and now the budget is $50,000. Roberts would like to know what makes up the miscellaneous income. \u201cHow does it go from $660,000 to $50,000? I don\u2019t see it as an issue for passage tonight,\u201d said Roberts.",
      "\u201cHow do these changes impact the final budget figures?\u201d asked Mrs. Nadeau. Roberts said that all the changes they just did bring the budget amount to $69,850,000. \u201cIt has been a very busy couple of weeks since we have received this budget, going line by line. It has been a very tedious process, but we have to do it,\u201d said Ms. Phongsavanh. She commended and thanked the rest of the committee for all their hard work on this. \u201cThis is a realistic budget that we are trying to submit,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter first passage, can this budget be changed before second passage?\u201d Mrs. Nadeau asked Atty. Ackerman. He thinks that if it\u2019s a minor change or a mistake, that it can be changed. \u201cAre we at the point where we should do first passage?\u201d asked Nadeau. \u201cI think we are. Do any other the directors that are here have any input or comments that they want to make before we pass it?\u201d asked Phongsavanh. Mr. Peter Fontaine thanked the committee for their hard work and also his fellow directors for working on this for the past three weeks. Phongsavanh added that the directors have been working very hard with them to get through this process and also thanked them. Motion to approve as amended: C. Roberts 2nd: J. Donlon Roll Call Vote: 4 yes APPROVED CONFERENCES: None",

      "SCHOOL COMMITTEE GOOD & WELFARE: E. Nadeau: She explained the resolution about the retirees, saying that it was always her understanding that any resolution was done during contract negotiations. She believes that is the time to bring this to the table. The next round of negotiations will start sometime in December. Nadeau doesn\u2019t think anyone is going to agree to anything unless everyone else is doing it (i.e. Fire, police, municipal employees). \u201cPeople want to be on the same page. You probably won\u2019t see that unless a receiver comes in, then all bets are off.\u201d She noted that everyone worked on this budget and it wasn\u2019t fun. \u201cThere are definitely no frills as far as I\u2019m concerned. I take offense to something Mr. Ward said this morning about the former school committee and administration, which we were a part of, and that we were incompetent for submitting a $59 million budget. We didn\u2019t come in with a $59 million budget. The City cut our budget! They took us to court and everything else. Mrs. Majewski was one of the most honest, hardworking people I have ever worked with! Three of the former school committee members are still here! I believe that it will come out that we aren\u2019t the bad guys. Hopefully this budget will go through and we will be able to provide a quality education, which we haven\u2019t been able to do because we have nickel and dimed to death! That\u2019s what I\u2019m here for.\u201d",

      "V. Phongsavanh: She attended the National Honor Society Awards at the high school. Phongsavanh said it was very gratifying for her to see that and deliver a speech telling them that it\u2019s up to them to make a better world for us. She also attended the CCF Annual Meeting. \u201cThey are doing many amazing things for our schools and replacing many programs that we cut.\u201d She announced that CCF is hosting a \u201cPassport to Kindergarten\u201d program tomorrow at Governor Pothier School. Phongsavanh has been meeting with statewide officials to bring in more resources for us. She reported that someone from RIDE committed to be on a new community group, Woonsocket Innovative Solutions to Education. \u201cWe will be promoting the positive stuff going on in the City. We are starting an email newsletter with the help of Riverz Edge and are in the beginning stages of looking at what model we want to consider for restructuring and streamlining our data collection for the education system.\u201d Phongsavanh has been writing weekly columns in The Call and posting them on her website: www.vimalaforschools.com. The last one highlighted the ESL and Math programs. C. Roberts: \u201cWe need to make structural changes as I thought everyone knew. Our inability to do so puts our retirees at risk. If you talk to Central Falls\u2019 retirees, they probably would have appreciated being approached before their health care costs went up 65%. It\u2019s no longer a contract negotiation because they are no longer employees. I intended to put this on the agenda again. We are looking to have a discussion.\u201d Roberts said it was a pleasure to attend the National Honor Society Awards night. He mentioned an interesting article he read about E. Greenwich schools talking about getting iPads for all their students and how it\u2019s a good contrast to what we are dealing with here in Woonsocket. Yesterday he had the opportunity to go to the State House to testify on the Kindergarten legislation that this committee had requested. He also brought letters from Linda Filomeno and Carol Lerner to deliver. He believes they were well-received by the House Finance Committee, even though it was tabled for further study. \u201cIt may still have life as a budget amendment.\u201d J. Donlon: Thanked the other committee members for their hard work on the budget. \u201cIt was a very enlightening experience.\u201d He asked Mr. Fontaine about the grounds outside the middle schools. \u201cWe have two new buildings and they look atrocious!\u201d Mr. Fontaine said he has one person and one lawn mower to do 14 buildings. \u201cIt has rained for the past five days. We are doing our best,\u201d said Fontaine. \u201cCould we look into hiring outside landscapers to do it?\u201d asked Donlon. \u201cThat\u2019s not the point. We have one groundskeeper and a half-time person at Barry Field to help out. We were cut 7 positions in the maintenance/custodial department. I take people off of other things to go and cut lawns when I can,\u201d said Fontaine. Donlon invited everyone to go to Ciro\u2019s for the Woonsocket school sports fundraiser. Motion to adjourn at 8:00 p.m.: C. Roberts 2nd: J. Donlon (Unanimously Approved) Respectfully submitted, Nancy G. Belisle, Substitute WSC Recording Clerk",

      "David Dilulis and Shawn Huxley of O\u2019Connor & Drew P.C. reviewed the financial audit conducted by their firm. Mr. Dilulis commented that, since they\u2019ve been on-board, there have been significant improvements in the accounting department. Because we are a governmental entity, they are required to issue two reports. One report is regarding the financial statements and the other focuses on internal controls. For the internal control report, the firm conducted a lot of testing in regards to receipts, disbursements, and payroll. As auditors, there are certain matters that they are required to communicate as a result of their audit. The firm used government auditing standards in conducting this audit. There are two important things to point out. First, they issued an un-qualified opinion of \u201cgoing concern.\u201d Next, if there were material weaknesses, significant deficiencies, other matters, the auditors would have to report that, but there were none. The internal control report is totally clean.",
      "Mr. Dilius provided an overview of the report. He pointed out that there were no audit adjustments or disagreements with management during the course of this audit. They are not hired to find fraud. They are just testing a sample from the areas tested. However, if any fraud were suspected, they would expand the testing sample. This was not the case here. He reviewed the financial statement pointing out a loss of about $1.6M for the year. After concluding his review, he opened to the Board for questions. Director St. Pierre said that he would like to read and digest the information and then he will likely have questions. Chairman Hartford asked Mr. Dilius to comment on what we were doing wrong in terms of our revenues versus our expenditures. Mr. Dilius said that in order to make the 1.2 (debt coverage ratio) to pass the covenant, we need to have an increase in revenue and a decrease in expenses of about $1.5M. He pointed out the recurring losses. Director St. Pierre referred to the comparison between 2010 and 2011. He pointed out that although revenues increased by $2M in 2011, salaries alone increased by about $1.8M. He said that to him this indicated an area where we needed to focus. Mike Geezil, Consultant to the Board, pointed out that the average detainee population increased from 609 to 649 from 2010 to 2011. Although this increased income, it had no positive effect on the facility\u2019s financial standing. The debt ratio remained the same between the two years. He commended the accounting department because there were no audit adjustments necessary during the completion of the audit. Lastly, he pointed out that depreciation and amortization are not taken into consideration in the bond document. These are non-cash issues and the issue is really one of cash flow.",
      "The report will be filed timely with the Bondholders before the May 31st deadline. Chairman Hartford suggested that next year, the Board should receive the report prior to the presentation so that they have the opportunity to review it.",
      "Motion to approve the audit report was made by Director St. Pierre, seconded by Director Romanowicz. All were in favor. Motion passed.",
      "B) Review of Crowley Commission Report Forensic Audit",
      "Chairman Hartford said that he looked at some of the recommendations in the report. First, the commission urges the Wyatt Detention Center to conduct a forensic audit with particular focus on the years preceding 2010. Based on the testimony it has received, the commission believes that there is evidence of prior mismanagement and that the potential benefits of such audit will far out-weigh the expenses. The facility must regain a solid reputation within the correctional industry as well as with local residents if it is to move forward and grow. Director St. Pierre pointed out that the audit will cost quite a lot of money. Next, Chairman Hartford read \u201cinvestigate the subpar work of the 2005 expansion. Proceeds from a performance bond will cover the necessary repairs.\u201d He asked if anyone could comment on the performance bond and whether it is still valid. He said that he has been advised that an insurance review is the first",
      "step in determining how any claims would be covered. He pointed out that Ernie Almonte had given a proposal. Attorney Lynch-Gadaleta said that, in her opinion, we should have engaged Ernie Almonte in November (2011). The Bondholders have formally said that the forensic audit should be done. The Commission has said it. All commentary related to Almonte conducting the audit, with his experience and reputation, has been positive with the exception of a comment made by Judge Flanders. She urged the Board to consider conducting the audit. She said that is going to cost money, but the money is available. She suggested that time is of the essence. Chairman Hartford said that he is skeptical about going down a path that is going to take time, money, and energy looking backwards when we should spend our resources for going forward. He said that it is clear now that we are going to have to do some level of audit. He is not convinced that what Almonte proposed is going to get the level of results that these people are looking for. He said that he would need more information about that proposal. Since Frank (Tillinghast) and Phil (St. Pierre) were involved in these discussions, he wants to make sure that what is proposed to be done is going to give us the product that we\u2019ve anticipated. Also, he doesn\u2019t agree (with Lynch-Gadaleta) that there is extra money to pay for this audit, but he recognizes that we have to expend it. Attorney Lynch-Gadaleta commented that we can\u2019t afford not to do it. She said that Almonte went to a sub-committee meeting a while back. She asked if the Chairman wanted to arrange for Almonte to meet with the sub-committee again to better-define the engagement. Director St. Pierre said that he would be more comfortable if the engagement letter were more detailed as to what Almonte was going to do. Attorney Lynch-Gadaleta suggested that the Finance sub-committee meet with Mr. Almonte for negotiations so that the sub-committee can report back to the entire Board at the next meeting. Mike Geezil suggested that we should have some list of potential recoveries from specific people and that we should have some idea that these people can pay before we proceed. He commented that getting a judgment against someone with no money is not an effective use of funds. He said we should have an idea of potential recovery in numerical amounts and some idea of potential expenses in numerical amounts before we agree to the audit. We should try to ensure that potential benefits outweigh costs. Second, he deferred to bond counsel, but suggested that we get the Bondholders to agree beforehand that this comes out of the reserve account so that there is no concern that the invoice will not be paid. Attorney Fracassa said that this is something that we could approach the bondholders with. He offered multiple ways of addressing it. Chairman Hartford agreed that we need an insurance review so that we know that we can collect against the policies if wrong-doing is uncovered so we can determine if the claims can be pursued. He agreed with Attorney Lynch-Gadaleta\u2019s recommendation to defer the matter back to the Finance committee so they could meet with Ernie Almonte one more time and come back to the Board with a final recommendation at the next meeting so that we can kick off the audit. Director St. Pierre asked if they should ask Mr. Almonte to come to the next Board meeting. Chairman Hartford said that, as long as they were prepared to make a recommendation, this was a good idea. He asked Attorney Fracassa to explore the option of obtaining the money from the reserve account to fund the audit. He said that maybe we should request that these monies not be held",
      "against us in our default, too. Director St. Pierre expressed concern that we didn\u2019t want to incur any costs or penalties as a result of expending the monies for the audit. Attorney Fracassa understood and agreed to make this part of his communication with the Bondholders. Next Chairman Hartford pointed out that the Commission requested that the State Department of Revenue assist in exploring the option of refinancing the bonds. He said that unless there is some state involvement in the refinancing efforts, he does not think it will be successful. He spoke to Rosemary Gallogly. Ms. Gallogly said that she was going to organize a meeting. If he is included, he would like to have Attorney Fracassa attend, too. Chairman Hartford suggested that we should give a response to the report. Attorney Lynch-Gadaleta said that we may be better situated to respond after the next Board meeting. Chairman Hartford said that he wanted to acknowledge that we\u2019ve received the report and that we would be looking at the recommendations and be prepared to respond within a couple months. Attorney Fracassa agreed to prepare a statement for the Chairman\u2019s approval and signature.",
      "C) Report of Finance Committee/mid-year budget adjustments",
      "Director St. Pierre reported that he met with Mike Geezil, Mr. Fair, and his staff. Discussion occurred, but at this point we are going to continue to look at ways to cut costs. It is a concern, and he feels that action needs to be taken related to expenditures. He intends to have more committee meetings to prepare a recommendation for the Board. We can not continue to lose money and not take any action.",
      "Warden Murphy commented that we are running the facility as efficiently as possible. Internally, we are controlling all of the things that we can control. He said that he had information to offer that would shed some positive light on the situation. Director Romanowicz reminded the group that Director Adamo asked for a list of vacancies. He said that maybe we should postpone filling positions. Warden Murphy commented that we are not bringing people aboard unless Mr. Fair feels it is a critical position. Director St. Pierre said that he suggested that we hire part-time Correctional Officers to cover overtime shifts. He said that we needed to look at alternatives. Warden Murphy said that we are running a maximum-security facility. Our Officers are peace officers. It is not a good job to have on a part-time basis. We are staffed appropriately.",
      "D) Current Cash Report and overview of accounts update Warden Murphy offered that we\u2019ve had changes in our population. Our ADP for April was 579. For the year, it is 592. We were at 616 last week. When we end the business day today, we should be at 673. Our situation has changed to the positive. Networking with our stakeholders has paid-off and we are going to continue our strategies. The changes can be attributed to major sweeps in CT. We remain in constant communication with the Marshals. Attorney Lynch-Gadaleta commented that the Warden was not giving himself credit. The increases that we are seeing are because of the quality of the individuals that we have here marketing the place. The Warden\u2019s reputation, as well as Mr. Fair\u2019s, is an advantage for us. Chairman Hartford concurred.",
      "E) Youth Summer Jobs Program.",
      "Deferred until next meeting",
      "F) Compensation for Filing and Preparation of Board Meeting Minutes",
      "Director St. Pierre recommended that Lori Pouliot be compensated, through a payroll stipend, for the work that she does in filing the agendas and preparing and filing the minutes for the Board. He recommended an amount of $50/month.",
      "Motion made by Director St.Pierre to compensate Lori Pouliot $50/month for preparing and filing Board minutes; seconded by Director Romanowicz. All were in favor. Motion passed.",

      "III. Advent International Presentation",
      "Mr. McKenna introduced Advent, and explained their focus is on control-oriented business transformation opportunities in select sectors that produce absolute returns. He mentioned EBITDA growth and its composition for European investments. Ms. Littlefield Sahlman walked through the firm\u2019s competitive landscape and described the firm\u2019s breakdown of personnel and sector focus. Mr. McKenna discussed the firm\u2019s operating expertise and described the operating partner program. He walked through the firm\u2019s deal types and their sector-based breakdown. Treasurer Raimondo asked about specifics on Fund VI. Ms. Sahlman and Mr. McKenna walked through metrics. Treasurer Raimondo asked about the realization on investments and their expected time horizon. Ms. Sahlman referenced the presentation for benchmarking, current investment performance and overall positive outlook on performance of open funds.",

Treasurer Raimondo asked about distributions paid in and cash multiples. Ms. Sahlman and Mr. McKenna explained the funds\u2019 leverage and entry price points. Ms. Littlefield Sahlman and Mr. McKenna left the room. Treasurer Raimondo asked Mr. Lynch how he decided the amount for investment to be granted to Advent International. Mr. Lynch responded by noting the $150 million that will be committed to private equity, with the intention of six to seven investments, thus the roughly $20 million for each LP. On a motion by Mr. Costello and seconded by Ms. Booth Gallogly, it was unanimously VOTED: to commit $20 million to Advent International, for investment in GPE VII predicated on satisfactory completion of all due diligence. Mr. Giudici was not present for the vote.",
      "IV. Pension Consulting Alliance\u2014Fixed Income Presentation",
      "Mr. Emkin updated the board about the current and forecasted economic landscape. Mr. Emkin and other investment collogues do not believe inflation will fall below 2.3% anytime in the foreseeable future, a challenge for the 7.5% annual return projection. He made four proposals: 1) fixed income in portfolio should match up with the role of the asset, 2) inflation sensitive securities should be added to the real return portfolio, 3) inflation linked equity assets to the real return portfolio, 4) and there should be a modest reduction in growth equity. Mr. Kenneth Goodreau explained some of these changes are simply a reassignment of bucketing in terms of asset allocation. Mr. Emkin said these changes would significantly reduce interest rate risk, helping the pension fund to achieve a goal of CPI + 4%, whereas the current portfolio is lucky to achieve CPI + 50bp. He highlighted the inclusion of MLPs in the portfolio for active management and inflation hedging. He stressed returns will be smoothed and yield will most likely increase looking ahead. Ms. Booth Gallogly asked how these changes might affect fees. Both Mr. Goodreau and Mr. Emkin explained there will be no significant change in fees. On a motion by Mr. Reilly and seconded by Ms. Booth Gallogly, it was unanimously VOTED: To accept the changes in portfolio composition and asset allocation on page 4 of PCA\u2019s presentation.",
      "V. Nautic Partners Presentation Mr. Gorgi stated that the goal for investments is a 2.5x growth in invested capital.

Ms. Booth Gallogly asked about duration, and Mr. Hillinksi explained, if IRR is increasing with time, it is apparent that there was some value to be unlocked. On a motion by Mr. Fay and seconded by Mr. Reilly, it was unanimously VOTED: to commit $20 million to Nautic Partners VII, predicated on satisfactory completion of all due diligence.",

Mr. Goodreau added the contract with State Street needs to be extended for price protection, even while considering other options. Ms. Paula McNamara asked about the other vendors under consideration. Mr. Goodreau responded that the other vendors are JPMorgan, Northern Trust Company and Bank New York Mellon. Mr. Goodreau stressed each proposal must be properly considered relative to the others, to compare apples to apples. Treasurer Raimondo concluded her staff needs more time to make sure comparison is done properly.",

      "2 BRWCT Trans-Atlantic Telecommunications Cable Fee The CRMC Policies and Procedures Subcommittee meet on May 22, 2012, and approved for full Council consideration a proposed process and agreement to promulgate the BRWCT fee on transatlantic cables. The fees could take affect as early as September 2012. Currently, one international telecommunications cable makes landfall in Rhode Island. After consulations with the cable\u2019s owner, AT&T, CRMC staff proposed establishing an annual fee of $40,000 for each operating international telecommunications cable making landfall in Rhode Island, and levying a one-time charge of $2,500 for each of the three inactive telecommunications cables, also owned by AT&T, also present in Rhode Island submerged lands (It is extremely unlikely that these cables will ever be utilized again.). Details on the levying of the BRWCT international telecommunications cable fees can be found at crmc.ri.gov. The RI Monitoring Collaborative has completed its 2010-2011 Summary of Environmental Monitoring Priorities. It is being prepared for paper distribution to the General Assembly and the Governor\u2019s Office. The Summary will also be delivered via email to a larger audience. BRWCT linkages in the Narragansett Bay Estuary Program draft Annual Workplan 2012-2013 Colt and NBEP Director Richard Ribb met in late March to review the draft NBEP annual work plan for 2012-2013. Colt proposed that the BRWCT provide $50,000 of in-kind salary match and $10,000 cash match for NBEP\u2019s Chris Deacutis\u2019s upper Narragansett Bay Bay Dissolved Oxygen field survey (via BRWCT\u2019s annual support of the URI GSO Coastal Hypoxia Research Program); in turn, the draft NBEP Work Plan would delineate NBEP staff support for the RI Environmental Monitoring Collaborative and the BRWCT Science Advisory Committee, and ensure that the 2012-2013 NBEP Climate Ready Estuaries Project would be well-coordinated with the work and priorities of the RI Climate Change Commission. Ribb requested that the proposed edits to the NBEP Annual Workplan be discussed by the BRWCT. Colt stated that the issue was on the agenda for later in the meeting and would be discussed then. BRWCT Proposal Review Process & Guidelines Colt asked for feedback on the previously distributed draft BRWCT Discretionary Funding Application Cover Sheet, the proposal budget template, and the draft guidelines and requirements for a more formalized proposal review process for the BRWCT. (Documents appended to these minutes.) Crawley stated that the new proposal review forms and guidelines are a good start to fulfilling the BRWCT request to the Chair to more clearly delineate the connections (or not) between a particular project proposal, and the priorities of the Bays, Rivers, and Watersheds Systems-Level Plan (SLP). Colt noted how the new guidelines will make it particularly important to set and stick with a regular annual schedule of BRWCT meetings. In addition to the new proposal review forms, Deciantis went through the SLP\u2019s Strategy Tables and numbered each Objective, Strategy and recommended action to make it easier for proposal writers to refer to relevant SLP policies and strategies. Colt also revised the column headings in the Strategy Tables to bring them more in line with planning terminology utilized by RI Statewide Planning:",

      "Colt requested input on whether proposals from the BRWCT agencies would continue to receive priority consideration. Flynn suggested that the BRWCT hold an annual proposal competition so that it had the opportunity to consider simultaneously multiple proposals. Uva noted the advantages of having the flexibility to target funds using the current approach of \u2018rolling\u2019 proposal reviews. Colt suggested that an annual competition could be run with a large portion of BRWCT discretionary project funds along with creation of smaller program development fund that would provide the BRWCT the ability to allocate funds across the year. Crawley noted concern that the BRWCT would still not have the opportunity to review multiple projects simultaneously unless two or more proposals happened to submitted at the same time. Kiernan expressed support for an annual proposal competition. If an initial round of review did not led to the complete expenditure of the available funds, a second proposal competition could be run. Kiernan also noted that if they didn\u2019t restrict the competition to state agencies, the BRWCT would be inundated with proposals for a relatively small amount of funding. Colt agreed, noting that the BRWCT relies on three sources of project funds: the OSPAR allocation for economic and environmental monitoring; the DEM Septage Fee revenues and, later in 2012, the CRMC trans-Atlantic Telecommunications Cable Fee. Colt agreed to draft guidance on an annual competition, suggesting that the BRWCT could allocate about $200,000 annually to the competition, while reserving $30,000 \u2013 50,000 for a program development fund. Uva stated that the BRWCT should require proposals to be explicitly linked to Systems-Level Plan priorities. Colt noted that the BRWCT Annual Work Plan should also provide discussion of updated SLP and BRWCT priorities for the annual competition. Colt recalled Uva\u2019s previous recommendation for the BRWCT to hire an environmental scientist. Colt noted that before such a hire could be made, the BRWCT needed to clarify further the mission and role of the BRWCT relative to BRWCT agency priorities for water resources strategic planning. In particular, more thought needed to be devoted to how the BRWCT should pursue and balance efforts project funding and implementation, and interagency coordination and strategic planning. Additionally, the BRWCT\u2019s linkages to the Governor\u2019s Office remain under-developed. Uva noted how the BRWCT has yet to pursue development of elements of its mission, such as the RI Economic Monitoring Collaborative. A functioning Collaborative could help determine the economic payback of pursuing different SLP goals and priorities, and thus help the BRWCT set priorities.",
      "4 Colt referred the BRWCT to his draft list of FY13 Workplan priorities distributed at the meeting, noting how the BRWCT, particularly his own efforts, will continue to emphasize maritime port development, municipal stormwater programs, climate change, and environmental monitoring. These priorities, and possibly others will be addressed in the FY13 Workplan that the BRWCT will have a chance discuss and possibly approve at the next BRWCT meeting in July Additional BRWCT Chair Projects Rhode Island Ports and Maritime Transportation Colt continues to work with Abby Swienton and others of Governor\u2019s Policy Office on RI port development strategy. The Port Marketing Collaborative legislation remains under active consideration by the RI General Assembly. Additional recommendations of the General Assembly\u2019s Port Facilities Commission Final Report, February 2012, are being pursued by the General Assembly and Rhode Island Agencies. Chafee Administration Performance Measurement Initiative Colt spoke to Brian Daniels about linking SLP implementation analysis with the Chafee Administration\u2019s Agency Performance Measurement Initiative. He attended briefing meetings convened by Daniels in April and May 2012 on DEM and CRMC\u2019s proposed performance indicators. Daniels and he agreed to follow up to continue discussing further collaborations. Rhode Island Climate Change Commission The Commission met for the second time on April 25, 2012. They are finalizing a Commission \u201cprogress report\u201d to the General Assembly. The next step is a conference call on working group co-chairs to be held May 24. Colt and BRWCT intern O\u2019Hare continue to lead the Habitats and Natural Resources Working Group with Save the Bay\u2019s Jane Austin and were responsible for completing the Working Group section of the forthcoming Commission Progress Report. Colt presented for the Working Group at the April 25th meeting. The Northeastern Regional Ocean Council Colt met recently with Grover Fugate to discuss the Northeast Regional Ocean Council and its coastal and marine spatial planning initiative. They also discussed how to provide Colt the opportunity to learn more about each BRWCT agency such as temporary re-locations to other state agency offices. Colt continues to serve as the Rhode Island alternate delegate to the Northeast Regional Ocean Council (NROC). Directors Fugate and Coit will serve as Rhode Island\u2019s representatives on the Northeast Regional [Ocean] Planning Board that is to be established in 2012 to the region\u2019s coastal and marine spatial planning project. Colt expects to continue to provide support to the DEM and CRMC Director\u2019s for this new organization and the NROC BRWCT Current Projects Large Marine Events Benefits Assessment Project A project stakeholders group is being assembled to make sure that all benefits of significance are going to be covered by the survey instruments that will be developed and utilized in July.",
      "5 Municipal Stormwater Partnership Program Scott provided the update to the BRWCT on the partnership between DEM, BRWCT, and the Town of Middletown. Scott and Colt have nearly completed an RfP and Scope of work to provide outreach and planning support to the Town of Middletown for stormwater management and financing. The BRWCT will have primary responsibility for executing the bidding process and the contract. Colt and Elizabeth Scott of DEM Office of Water Resources plan to finalize the RfP with Middletown and issue the RfP in June 2012. In the fall of 2011, the Office of Water Resources with support from BRWCT Intern England conducted an initial feasibility study for the Town of Middletown, working with the Town Manager and the Public Works Director and other local officials to identify what their current and future stormwater management needs are, and to develop an initial review of how a stormwater utility district (SUD) would work for Middletown. Scott and BRWCT intern England presented on their work in December 2011 to the Middletown Town Council. No action at the meeting was taken by the Town Council in terms approving going forward with a more detailed SUD development and education assessment. Over the course of the spring of 2012, Middletown Town Manager Shaun Brown agreed that the town had a significant need for stormwater utility. When he presented this to the Town Council in March 2012, they agree that SUD assessment and education efforts should be pursued. The Council voted to agree to work with DEM and BRWCT on this project. The project will establish a stakeholders group, further assess what the town\u2019s stormwater management goals and objectives should be, conduct a detailed cost of stormwater management services analysis, and develop an implementation strategy for stormwater utility. A \u201croadmap\u201d of decisions the town will need to reach to establish a SUD will also be developed, including identifying additional studies. The project will also identify data systems that the town would need to implement a stormwater utility. There is a concern, on the part of the Town Manager as well as other communities they have worked with, regarding local properties that border state roads as well as properties on town roads that lack any stormwater infrastructure. It isn\u2019t clear how stormwater utility fees could be applied to such properties. National stormwater utility experts have pointed out that fees can be assessed for such properties because the town must provide certain stormwater services that apply to all properties regardless of the type or presence of stormwater infrastructure. Scott and Colt have discussed with DEM Chief Legal Council, Mary Kay, a request to DEM Office of Legal Services and to the Department of Administration to analyze these matters further. Flynn expressed concern about the uncertainties regarding a legal nexus between the stormwater fees assessed and services rendered for these types of properties. Scott agreed that is precisely the issue that needs additional legal analysis. The town needs to be able to demonstrate how all town properities require the services of a local stormwater program that a SUD would finance. Colt complemented Scott on the strength and comprehensiveness of the project\u2019s proposed scope of the work. As a BRWCT project emphasis is on partnering with Middletown, not compelling them to take certain action to properly finance local stormwater management needs, and is a good example of how the BRWCT is pursuing the SLP\u2019s call for additional technical and financial",
      "6 support to local governments for stormwater management specifically, and water resources management specifically. Walker expressed concern that the amount of funding being made available, $35,000, for the project was insufficient to pursue the entire scope of work. He noted the importance of persuading Middletown to \u201cbuy into\u201d this project and being fully committed to its execution, including possibly providing some of its own funding to ensure the project is completed as intended. Colt agreed this was a legitimate concern and promised to pursue discussions with Middletown officials accordingly. Proposals for BRWCT funding review Assessing Climate Risks to RI Wastewater Treatment Facilities The BRWCT reviewed the DEM Office of Water Resources\u2019 proposal for a statewide assessment of wastewater treatment facility risks and vulnerabilities to climate change, a proposal originally submitted to its March 29, 2012 meeting. TetraTech believes that the 2007 Blackstone River model can be used for this risk assessment. The total proposed cost of the assessment is $59,000; this price assumes that the project will be able to utilize the 2007 Blackstone River model. This project would build upon TetraTech\u2019s current work with the RI Department of Health to assess climate change risks for Rhode Island\u2019s drinking water supplies and infrastructure. Thus the proposal represents a great opportunity to leverage BRWCT funds. Kiernan noted that the transfer of BRWCT funds to TetraTech, via a pre-existing USGS agreement, has not yet been reviewed and approved as a sole source contract arrangement by the Department of Administration. Colt asked if Kiernan thought that such an approval was possible. Kiernan said the issue remained unresolved and agreed to investigate it further. Crawley stated that this proposed project exemplifies well the leveraging potential of targeted BRWCT funds in that this project will build upon the ongoing work of a state agency (in this case the Department of Health). In light of uncertainties about the proposed contracting mechanism to provide BRWCT funding for the project and the utility of the 2007 Blackstone model, Colt suggested that the BRWCT could defer again on deciding whether to fund it until more information was provided. He asked for a motion to defer the funding decision on the proposal until the next BRWCT meeting in July pending approval of the proposed use of a USGS agreement with TetraTech, and the provision of additional information on project deliverables The BRWCT approved unanimously a motion to defer their funding decision on the proposal until it was provided additional information on project deliverables, cost, and contract administration. Update of Statewide GIS Data Layer for Impervious Cover Last week Colt was informed that Statewide Planning could not provide the funding needed to implement this project, as was suggested by Statewide Planning at the March 29, 2012, BRWCT",
      "7 meeting. At that meeting, the BRWCT had agreed to fund it if Statewide Planning could not come up with the necessary funds. The project cost has increased from ____ to $25,000 because of the 5% USGS contract administration fee. Walker reiterated his concerns about the potential misuse of the data by town officials. The BRWCT unanimously approved a motion approve funding for the proposal. New BRWCT Initiatives Convening the Rhode Island Environmental Monitoring Collaborative and the BRWCT Science Advisory Commitee to develop a statement of research and monitoring priorities for Narragansett Bay water quality Colt distributed a draft resolution for the BRWCT to consider (Draft resolution appended to these meeting minutes.) He has discussed with DEM\u2019s Kiernan, Alicia Good, and Narragansett Bay Commission\u2019s Tom Uva. The resolution calls for utilization of the BRWCT\u2019s of its standing committees, in this case the Environmental Monitoring Collaborative and the Science Advisory Committee, to convene a work group to lead this effort. The resolution addresses a need that is widely recognized as important for water quality management in Narragansett Bay. The BRWCT can help by spurring development consensus and greater understanding on the key priorities for monitoring and research regarding water quality in Narragansett Bay. Colt noted that this effort would need to dovetail with proposed science workshops being discussed by BRWCT, RI Sea Grant, and the NBEP. However he stated that the urgency of developing and communicating a set of common goals for Narragansett Bay water quality monitoring and research requires that this work start as soon as possible, especially given the uncertainties surrounding when such science workshops would actually be convened. He also noted that this effort would have to dovetail with work by the RI Environmental Monitoring Collaborative and Watershed Counts to develop overall environmental monitoring priorities and indicators for Rhode Island. Walker asked that Colt refer to priorities and goals in the SLP the last paragraph of the draft resolution. Colt asked the team members to examine the resolution, provide feedback in the coming weeks and be prepared to approve the resolution at its next meeting in July. Proposed changes to the Narragansett Bay Estuary Program (NBEP) draft Annual Workplan 2012-2013 intended to increase linkages between the BRWCT and the NBEP Colt distributed copies of proposed changes to the NBEP draft Annual Workplan for 2012-2013 and asked for feedback from the BRWCT. He reviewed how he and NBEP Director Richard Ribb had met in late March to discuss these changes and had he felt, achieved some agreement on them at that time. His proposed changes entailed identification in the NBEP work plan of the roles and responsibilities of the RI Environmental Monitoring Collaborative and the BRWCT Science Advisory Committee for those priority Workplan actions proposed by the NBEP that clearly overlap with the responsibilities and priorities of the BRWCT and the standing committees. Colt noted that the BRWCT has provided match to the NBEP annual federal grant from EPA since 2007, primarily as in-kind match using his salary. In the current NBEP project year, 7/1/11 to 6/30/12, the BRWCT is providing over $89,000 in match via Colt\u2019s salary and the funds the",
      "8 BRWCT provides for large river monitoring. Colt stated his belief that the provision of such substantial match by BRWCT necessitates that the BRWCT should assess annually how the NBEP is contributing to the mission and functions of the BRWCT, and how it does could be improved over time. He stated that he was not asking the BRWCT at this time to require agreement on the proposed work plan changes in order for the BRWCT match to be provided for the next NBEP project year, running from 7/1/12 to 6/30/13. Ribb stated that he did not agree with or accept the proposed changes to the NBEP Workplan because the NBEP was a bi-state program and therefore could not permit these changes to be made. He noted that these proposed changes resembled the requirements stipulated two years ago by DEM Director Sullivan whereby Sullivan required changes to the NBEP Workplan before he was willing to sign it. Colt pointed out that the BRWCT also has a statutory responsibility to work closely with Massachusetts and upper watershed stakeholders on Narragansett Bay management. Kiernan stated that she felt the proposed changes were acceptable and would not alter the intent and priority actions of the NBEP Workplan as drafted. She did not understand how they were not permissible simply because the NBEP seeks to work on a bi-state basis with regard to the Narragansett Bay watershed. Walker stated that he agreed that BRWCT\u2019s ability to provide state match to federally or independently funded programs should be used first to adance projects and activities that furthered the BRWCT mission and responsibilities. Uva expressed concern about the BRWCT requiring changes to another program\u2019s Workplans. Crawley encouraged Colt to explore other means such as memoranda of agreement between the BRWCT and the NBEP that could be produced that would achieve the same goal of increasing the linkages between the BRWCT and the NBEP. The BRWCT asked that Ribb provide comments and edits to the proposed changes to the NBEP workplan articulating his concerns regarding them further and in writing.

WHEREAS, The RI Bays, Rivers, and Watersheds Coordination Team (RI BRWCT) is responsible for establishing \u201coverall goals\u201d for the management, restoration, & utilization of Narragansett Bay as established in the Rhode Island Bays, Rivers, and Watersheds Systems-Level Plan: 2009-2013 (SLP). WHEREAS, The RI Environmental Monitoring Collaborative, a standing committee of the RI BRWCT, is responsible for designing and implementing a state-wide environmental monitoring system. WHEREAS, The RI BRWCT Science Advisory Committee provides scientific and technical guidance to the RI BRWCT to support implementation and evaluation of the SLP, helps to develop and apply integrated environmental and economic monitoring systems for aquatic resources and their sustainable use, and assesses the status and efficacy of public and non-profit investments in scientific research relevant to Rhode Island\u2019s aquatic resources and its water-reliant economy. WHEREAS, Together the RI Environmental Monitoring Collaborative and the RI BRWCT Science Advisory Committee provide an excellent platform for estuarine scientists, managers, and outreach specialists to communicate authoritatively and collaboratively to RI executive and legislative leaders on the scientific and monitoring priorities needs for cost-effectively managing and restoring the water quality of Narragansett Bay and its tributaries. WHEREAS, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and the US Environmental Protection Agency must address and remediate the consequences of eutrophication in Narragansett Bay and the point and nonpoint sources of nutrients discharged into Narragansett Bay and its watershed. WHEREAS, In the next 2-7 years the beneficial consequences of reduced wastewater treatment facility nutrient discharges for Narragansett Bay, particularly increases in dissolved oxygen concentrations, should become discernable, chemically, physically, and biologically. THEREFORE, The RI BRWCT respectfully requests that RI Environmental Monitoring Collaborative, RI Sea Grant, and the Narragansett Bay Estuary Program to organize and convene a joint working group of experts and stakeholders to develop and issue collaboratively a comprehensive statement of monitoring and research priorities for assessing ecological responses to and water quality improvements stemming from mandated reductions in wastewater treatment facility discharges of nutrients into",
      "13 Narragansett Bay and its watershed. The statement should incorporate information on key scientific questions and monitoring parameters, as well as estimated costs and timeframes for successfully fulfilling the priority research and monitoring needs. This statement of scientific and monitoring priority should be dovetailed with ongoing work by the RI Environmental Monitoring Collaborative to establish overall environmental monitoring priorities for Rhode Island\u2019s fresh and marine water resources and environments, as well as with future science workshops convened under the auspices of the RI BRWCT Science Advisory Committee by the RI BRWCT, RI Sea Grant, and the Narragansett Bay Estuary Program."

      "I. Call to Order \u2013 Dan Meuse called the meeting to order at 7:30am. He welcomed members and advised that for the summer months this group would be considering a time shift to consistently meeting at 8:30am during the summer months as opposed to alternating between 7:30am and 8:30 am. After checking in with members and reviewing attendance records we will email out if a change is made. Mr. Meuse then moved into the topic discussion of the day.",
      "II. Presentation on Qualified Health Plan (hereafter QHP) Selection [Slides available upon request and on website]",
      "Questions/Comments/ Clarifications a. Jason Martiesian: On the second bullet under maximize enrollment,",
      "can you speak a bit more on market power needs? i. Dan Meuse: It is not necessarily a statement on what the exchange is going to do in three years. If in the future the exchange wants to push for changes it wants to push some new innovation that is not necessarily here in the marketplace right now, it would have trouble doing that without a base of covered lives. Classic negotiation is that you cannot go and demand something of a provider of services if you do not have someone to purchase those services at that time. The exchange is a stronger medium as it provides the way to access tax credits and subsidies to make insurance more affordable, but we recognize that if you go to an insurer and say we really want this change, this new product, this innovation with no customer base to speak of you will not be that successful. That is where that bullet comes from.",
      "b. Mark Deion: I know you can extrapolate it from the worst here, maximize enrollment, but specifically a cost structure that is less than what currently exists. I think that needs to be a high level priority \u2013 when the Mass Connector was initially started they went for enrollment but they did not deal with cost structure and payment structure. The cost factor needs to be significantly benchmarked. That priority of cost fulfills a lot of these other bullets.",
      "i. Deb Faulkner: The challenge is that you get into this vicious cycle, if you don\u2019t set up something that can negotiate and has enrollment, then you cannot monitor cost.",
      "ii. Mark Deion: I agree, but they need to be woven together. iii. Elaina Goldstein: I believe that on the cost front you need to",
      "look at what is happening on the initial start up. When talking about what health plans are going to have to meet the benefits package that we set. I was looking at this discussion of WHP selection to not include the cost discussion \u2013 feeling that perhaps these are parallel tracks. We have the health plans, we have done this, now how do we do what we need to in the exchange, barring the EHB package. The Issue is what kinds of market reforms can be made with providers by the exchange. Do we want the exchange to be able to push, yes enrollment, but further.",
      "iv. Dan Meuse: Your parallel track discussion is absolutely relative. One of the standards for QHP certification is that you have EHB, in the coming months these become one track.",
      "c. Rich Glucksman: Can you explain what you mean under bullet two under encourage market innovation?",
      "i. Dan Meuse: The priority to encourage market innovation is done so in order to meet some of the goals and principles. If the exchange wants to have an active role in impacting cost trends and impacting delivery system effectiveness, it cannot necessarily do that without impacting innovation factors. In essence the priority is meant to say that if the exchange wants to incent or demand or require the same types of market innovations that are being pushed by other state programs, then that encouragement of innovation must be pushed as it selects QHPS.",
      "d. Elaina Goldstein: United and BCBS, the products that you can sell in the exchange are the same products that you can sell outside the exchange are those the same in the individual market and the small group market?",
      "i. Dan Meuse: In a way, yes. The current plan structure in the small group market vs. federal minimum guidelines. For the most part, plans offered by two dominant carriers offer would meet requirements, but they will need to tier them.",
      "ii. Elaina Goldstein: As an individual, the only place that I would have choice as an individual would be in the exchange or could the carriers be offering in the individual market outside the exchange? From a consumer standpoint why would I go to the exchange, if I do not meet the subsidy?",
      "iii. Jason Martiesian: I think that is the question, you will have a marketplace on the exchange that small employers and individuals who are eligible for a subsidy will have a place to",
      "purchase, but for an exchange to be successful you are going to want to attract individual and small employers who do not meet the subsidy requirements to purchase through the exchange to help it sustain itself. Having the products and the consumer experience is key.",
      "iv. Dan Meuse: There are a couple of policy questions that affect that inside/outside the exchange choice. The administration put forth a bill that would require issuers to offer something inside the exchange and something exactly the same outside the exchange. The idea for that was that if you a considering going through the exchange you can compare apples to apples plans, and then decide apples to oranges. If plan X inside the exchange and plan x outside the exchange are the same, then I can compare plans A, B, C that are also outside the exchange and see how they compare with those inside the exchange as you have x as a constant.",
      "v. Elaina Goldstein: Very few people read their plan of evidence, when they could chose it was what is the least expensive plan, does it cover what I need \u2013 okay. If a plan costs 500 in the exchange and 475 outside, then they would go with outside.",
      "vi. Deb Faulkner: Products will cost the same inside and outside the exchange. What will bring people to the exchange first is the subsidy, but then also is that it is an easy place that people can see all their options in one place, and compare and have a resource to make the process really easy. We do not know that people will make that choice, or if they will go to the individual issuers.",
      "e. Mark Deion: One of the reasons why we are doing the exchange is that the least expensive plans currently offered by insurers are not affordable. The exchange will be able to develop a plan that is less expensive than what is currently available, but the cost inside and outside will be mirrored. The idea that BCBS will suddenly come up with a plan outside the exchange that is markedly less is unlikely in my mind as they aren\u2019t doing that now.",
      "i. Jason Martiesian: I just disagree with that, understanding that we are not focusing on this today.",
      "ii. Linda Katz: You should be able to compare right on the website that you are buying, but there is also a huge consumer assistance piece that will come with the exchange. Part of the value of marketing the exchange, is that you want to buy there because there will be a lot of assistance that many do not have access to.",
      "iii. Elaina Goldstein: I disagree, but I just don\u2019t know what is the value proposition for people to buy through the exchange.",
      "iv. Dan Meuse: Is there a potential for that, yes, but it is something we can work through and in addition to marketing the exchange to be very enticing.",
      "f. Tom Dwyer: Suppose that no issuer is willing to offer a plan in the exchange, where does that leave the exchange in RI?",
      "i. Dan Meuse: That is a worst-\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090case scenario. If we fail terribly and that happens, there is actually going to be a plan on the exchange not currently offered in the state available from the office of personal management, multi state plans, so we will have a player or players to be named later who will participate in the exchange. The issuer would most likely be a large national carrier that currently provides for federal employees, it could be like an AETNA or a CIGNA, or someone else.",
      "ii. Tom Dwyer: This would be some nationally established plan benchmarked on federal plan?",
      "iii. Dan Meuse: Theoretically the multi state plans will have the state specific EHB that each has selected, will be included within that nationally based plan. So yes there would be plans for sale in the exchange if none of our current domestic carriers elected to participate in the exchange.",
      "g. Domenic Delmonico: I think a principle that needs to be here is simplicity. I would suggest that the word simple be embedded into this -\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090 as we get too sophisticated with all this, we will lose folks.",
      "i. Dan Meuse: I don\u2019t disagree, but I will push back. There are certain items that people care about. Are their providers there and how much does it cost to pay their providers, but they don\u2019t care about as a policy the state and the exchange see it as a way to push innovation in the delivery market.",
      "ii. Domenic Delmonico: The Mass connector have wrestled with this since they started, for certain folks purchasing these, there are a level of safety and safeguards that get into these products, but not in the choice side. Where is MA on the simplicity side?",
      "iii. Deb Faulkner: It is a spectrum that we are going to be working on depending on the issues \u2013 evolve with what makes the most sense in Rhode Island. Very different for individuals and small employers, different from small group and large group in MA. Over time they had to evolve towards more specification, and we are going to go through some of that here, the balance of keeping it simple, promoting the things we ant to promote, keeping carriers engaged and meeting some of the goals that we want to meet while still keeping in mind market objectives. The pressure point between a market based solution and a standardization-\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090based solution to me is that it is a balancing act we are going to continually deal with on an ongoing basis. We want to get a start on this at least \u2013 MA models do not",
      "completely apply as they have a different market, stakeholders have intimated that they do not adore the Utah model, we have experience with health pact that we need to adjust etc, but we are striking our own ground.",
      "h. Jason Martiesian: EMR incentive piece, how is that a product plan design?",
      "i. Domenic Delmonico: The theory is that the more advanced you are at doing EMR and patient centered medial home, then the more you are certified.",
      "ii. Dan Meuse: I will give an example, not one the exchange expects to do, we could say will rate your EMR incentive level, not if you give a less than market high incentive. That evaluation ability is undefined right now, we can think through different definitions of it, and as we get into criteria of it some are different than QHP level.",
      "i. Stacy Paterno: How will some of the things we are looking at here going to align with what we are discussing today.",
      "i. Dan Meuse: That gets a bit to the process of certification and standards. There is a policy decision that the state will be thinking through: at which level of regulation and contracting do certain items get entered. Right now the affordability standards are market wide; are there other items that get into the federal minimum QHP standards that are better suited to be a market wide thing than a QHP thing. Does the exchange make certain requirements or does OHIC make certain requirements. That is where we think through things like this.",
      "ii. Deb Faulkner: Starting with the OHIC regulatory requirements, which ones fit and don\u2019t fit, and where does it add on. There are some things that add on, and make us revisit affordability standards market wide perhaps. There is nothing we are going to do that is inconsistent with affordability standards, but are we going to add on to that, and if we are do we need to refine those standards along the way.",
      "iii. Dan Meuse: We are looking at a population looking at the exchange who will be flipping back and for the between the exchange and Medicaid over months and years. We also need to consider do we need to do the same for Medicaid.",
      "iv. Stacy Paterno: Then I would say how does that get into the state wide coordinated health plan? There are public health issues, tied in there etc. I would love to see a slide showing us how this all works together. The reality is that you can think like meaningful use, trying to do the right but unintentionally knocking something over.",
      "v. Dan Meuse: In the Lt. Governor\u2019s office, the best way to avoid those unintended consequences is to have this process be as",
      "open and transparent as possible, and have as many people in the room as possible.",
      "j. Stacy Paterno: Are we talking about plans on the subsidized exchange or?",
      "i. Dan Meuse: Both. ii. Stacy Paterno: How do you line those up with what is",
      "happening with Medicaid right now? iii. Dan Meuse: Let\u2019s call this an aspirational list at times?",
      "k. Rich Glucksman: To the left hand column on example innovation criteria are you of the belief tat none of these exist today?",
      "i. Dan Meuse: If we know we are going to have a multi-\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090state plan and it is cheaper because it doesn\u2019t participate in patient centered medical home etc, it will look cheaper, but it will look cheaper for the wrong reasons, and will be lacking in things policy decision-\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090makers feel are important for our consumers. Thus the thought then follows: do we need to expand our state criteria.",
      "ii. Rich Glucksman: It is then a reassuring message that carriers here are doing the things that you look and want to continue that moving forward?",
      "iii. Dan Meuse: Yes, and from the staff perspective we want to ensure that carriers who are currently participating in market reforms are doing so, are encouraged to continue doing so. We also want to encourage carrier-\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090based innovation, balancing a drive toward an alignment with market decisions \u2013 it is that balance.",
      "l. Linda Katz: Is there a crosswalk between what Medicaid is doing in these areas, what the commercial market is doing, and what is mandated or required?",
      "i. Rich Glucksman: That is a great idea and I know we would be happy to put that forward to show what we are doing in that department.",
      "ii. Linda Katz: Yes, I think that would be key, to pull it all back in, with Medicaid, so we have that alignment.",
      "III. Public Comment \u2013 No additional comment put forward.",
      "IV. Adjourn \u2013 the meeting adjourned at 9:00am. Next meeting June 18, 2012"

      "The 294th meeting of the Rhode Island Student Loan Authority was held on Friday May 25, 2012 in the McKenna Conference Room, 560 Jefferson Boulevard, Warwick, Rhode Island. Members in attendance: Dr. Anthony Santoro Dr. William Croasdale Mr. John Howell Ms. Patti Doyle Mr. Chris Feisthamel, Designee of the General Treasurer Others in attendance: Mr. Charles Kelley Mr. Noel Simpson Mr. Joseph Palumbo Ms. Jennifer Dutch Mr. Kevan McAleer Mrs. Lindie Thibodeau Johnson Ms. Lisa Labelle The meeting was called to order by Dr. Santoro at 10:13 a.m. Chairman\u2019s Report There was no Chairman\u2019s Report. Executive Director\u2019s Report There was no Executive Director\u2019s Report College Planning Center Survey Mrs. Thibodeau Johnson handed out the College Planning Center Survey and went over the results with the board members. Dr. Santoro inquired about a synergy between the CPC and Way to Go. He believes there is an opportunity to merge Way to Go with the CPC. Way to Go works with students earlier in school and CPC helps with college planning process. The members discussed ways to encourage more public participation in the College Planning Center and how parents play a critical role in the college planning process.",
      "Focus Group Project Ms. Labelle prepared a summary of the RFP for the board to review. There was a not to exceed price of $23,000. Ms. Doyle recused herself from the discussion. Action Item #5: Selection of Vendor Upon a motion made by Mr. Howell and seconded by Mr. Feisthamel it was unanimously VOTED to approve RISLA\u2019s staff\u2019s recommendation of Market Decision. Ms. Doyle recused herself from voting. Report on Senator Durbin Bankruptcy Bill Mr. Kelley stated that under current law federal loans and supplemental student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy. Senator Durbin has introduced a bill that would extend bankruptcy protection to borrowers who owe on private student loans. Mr. Kelley stated that the impact of this legislation on RISLA should be minimal. At RISLA, 98% of the loans have a borrower and a co-maker. If one claims bankruptcy, the other is still liable. RISLA\u2019s default rate is less than 2%. Mr. Kelley stated that expanding bankruptcy to include supplemental student loans could have an impact on new bond issues with regard to rating agencies. Mr. Kelley stated that RISLA currently has approximately $20 million student only loans, which makes up less than 2% of the portfolio. Mr. Kelley said that RISLA\u2019s reserve funds would need to be greater and bad debt reserves would need to be boosted if this legislation is enacted. Student Loan Policy Discussion Mr. Kelley reported that RIFEL Loans for the 12/13 academic year will have the added flexibility of income based repayment similar to Federal Stafford Loans and which the Federal PLUS Loan does not have. Action Item #8: Election of Officers No vote was taken. At 11:03, upon a motion made by Mr. Howell and seconded by Mr. Feisthamel, the board entered into Executive Session based on Litigation \u2013 pursuant to RIGL 42-46-5 (a)(2). Ms. Doyle was absent for the vote, All other members present voted in favor. At 11:43 the open session reconvened. Chairman Santoro stated that no votes were taken in the closed session. Upon a motion made my Mr. Howell and seconded by Mr. Feisthamel it was unanimously VOTED to seal the minutes of the Executive Session. Upon a motion made by Dr. Croasdale and seconded by Mr. Howell it was unanimously",
      "VOTED to adjourn at 11:44. ________________________________ John Howell, Secretary"

Philip Brooks moved, David Buffum seconded, to approve the minutes of May 19. Harry Sterling, David Buffum, Martha Fuller, George Dechambeau in favor, Philip Brooks abstained. Presentation by Steve Levy, Atlantic States Rural Water and Wastewater Association. A confidential income survey has been sent to all year-round customers of PIWD, to prepare for grant applications to U.S. Department of Agriculture, Rural Development, and for a Community Development Block Grant (CDBG). Each agency has its own requirements: USDA bases grants on median household income, CDBG requires 51% below a certain level. May also consider Rhode Island State Revolving Fund. To be valid, there must be responses from 90% of the 45 surveyed. Application for CDBG must go through the town of Portsmouth. In preparing for a new Broadway Tank, and for application to USDA, RD, we must have detailed engineering plans, so the next step is to hire an engineer who is experienced in working with USDA. Steve Levy suggested that we distribute a request for qualifications, which Steve Levy will prepare by June 30. We can issue this request in early July, review possibilities in July, hire an engineer in August, and apply to USDA in the Fall. Treasurer\u2019s Report. Distributed. Martha Fuller moved, Philip Brooks seconded, to approve. Passed unanimously. Past due accounts report. Most past due accounts have now been paid. Letter to be sent with July bill, forgiving past penalty charges. Martha Fuller moved, David Buffum seconded, to approve the letter as edited. Passed unanimously. Review 5/19 meeting \u2013 desalinization. The Board needs to keep current on possible sources of funds to support new sources of water: desalinization, new wells, etc. Facilities Improvement Plan\u2014The RI DOH will pay for a facilities improvement plan to be developed. They contract with Northeast Water Solutions to prepare this plan, in consultation with the Board. Larry Anderson, VP of Northeast Water Solutions, will meet with us at the June 30 Board meeting to begin the process. Office Manager/Bookkeeper\u2019s report. Distributed.

May report absent of bacteria. Streamflow and well monitoring done. Posted shutoff notices at delinquent customers\u2019 houses. 04 Beach Road: the customer excavated, System Manager replaced valve. A curb stop is needed at the Mossop residence, 03 Beach Road; will be installed. During April drought, had to use #4 Indian Spring well. Have not needed it in May.

      "applied for and will mean that a TIP Amendment will be needed in many instances to add the",
      "funds into the TIP. Ms. Breslin answered that the TIP cannot be amended until the",
      "grant/discretionary funds are awarded. Mr. Rhodes explained that under the current",
      "agreement, discretionary awards can be handled as an Administrative Amendment. This",

      "Sherrill commented how there is so much weaving between tasks. Ms. Sherrill also noted that a",

      "Mr. Schiller commented that a bicycle advocate mentioned to him that other states have a state",

      "biking community is anxious to have a statewide bicycle plan. Mr. Rhodes commented he",
      "probably would not be supportive of a separate bicycle plan from the State Guide Plan. Looking",
      "at what bicycle initiatives have been completed and what the current needs are could be part of",

      "a project. For example, the Town of Johnston does not want a bike path but the City of",
      "Cranston does and they do not want the State dictating to them on the project. Also there are",

      "added that she felt locating state offices in this downtown Providence building would provide a",
      "perfect opportunity to capitalize on transit. Ms. Callaghan stated there are a variety of state",

      "introductory content that provides an overview of the structure of the Statewide Planning",
      "Program and the context in which the work is completed. Section 2 has incorporated a lot more",
      "content this year as there is a lot more reporting on Statewide Planning\u2019s progress throughout",

      "available, and the estimated cost per task. Mr. Rhodes noted that the importance of Table 4-1",
      "which lists each of the tasks with the total cost breakdown by funding source. The total",
      "estimate personnel budget for FY 13 is $3.2 million. The budget\u2019s funding resources include 56",

      "Other funds are contractual or as grants such as the Rail Plan, Safe Routes to School, and",

      "resources that are projected to be available over the coming fiscal year. Mr. Rhodes asked if",
      "there were any comments on Section 4. There were none.",
      "Mr. Rhodes then asked Mr. Shawver and Mr. Therrien to discuss the appendix which covers",
      "RIDOT and RIPTA. Mr. Shawver stated that the appendix covers non-project related funds such",
      "as the bike program, highway statistics, GIS program, planning studies i.e., commuter rail and",
      "environmental studies. Other items also include historical preservation and work with the",
      "University of Rhode Island to promote engineering for students. Mr. Baudouin asked if it",
      "covered traffic congestion efforts. Mr. Shawver responded the information includes such items",
      "as traffic calming and calculating accident data.",
      "Mr. Therrien stated that there is no specific category for planning funds for RIPTA. Therefore,",
      "they use a portion of the formula funds for planning projects. Mr. Therrien added that RIPTA\u2019s",
      "recent planning efforts have involved a lot of public participation. He continued that there were",
      "over 50 people for a recent meeting about rapid transit on Broad Street, as well as a good",
      "turnout of about 30 people for a recent meeting regarding Hope Street. Mr. Schiller added that",
      "these public participation numbers are very positive especially when reporting to the federal",
      "government.",
      "Ms. Shocket asked if there were any other questions or comments. Mr. Murray then moved",
      "that the Transportation Advisory Committee (TAC) recommend to the State Planning Council",
      "approval of the revised draft FY 2013 Unified Work Program for Transportation Planning.",
      "The motion was seconded by Mr. Stuart and approved unanimously by the TAC.",

      "7. Additional Public Comment",
      "Ms. Shocket asked if there was any additional public comment.",
      "Mr. Grant Dulgarian thanked the TAC and staff for responding to his previous comments at the",
      "Public Hearing last month. There were three comments he wanted to clarify. Mr. Dulgarian\u2019s",
      "first comment was for page 8 of the TIP in which he clarified that he was referring I-195 over the",
      "East Providence / Providence line rather than I-95 as referred in the report. His second",
      "comment was in reference to page 50, and how the response to the comment was the same the",
      "response to his first comment. He stated the he does not feel that it seems to correspond to his",
      "request to regulate billboards. Ms. Callaghan answered that the control of outdoor billboards",
      "and advertising was not eligible for Transportation Enhancement funding. Mr. Shawver stated",
      "that page 50 is just listing what the program funds and not the regulation under Rhode Island",
      "General Laws, which the TAC cannot change. Mr. Dulgarian\u2019s third comment was in reference to",
      "page 65, where he believes the TIP should include steps to increase RIPTA ridership. Mr.",
      "Therrien replied that RIPTA\u2019s ridership has nothing to do with the TIP. He added that there are",
      "no federal funds dedicated for the bus route that services Miriam Hospital. Mr. Therrien",
      "continued that if RIPTA buses routes have low ridership, they will be discontinued. Mr. Therrien",
      "suggests that Mr. Dulgarian come to a RIPTA board meeting to discuss any specific routes of",
      "concern. Mr. Rhodes stated that the text on page 65 of the TIP is not defining what routes will",
      "be included. Ms. Shocket added that the TAC does not micromanage RIPTA and that Mr.",
      "Dulgarian\u2019s questions should be directed at RIPTA. Mr. Schiller commented that there are",
      "bigger issues involved and that Miriam Hospital has expanded parking into the neighborhood.",
      "He felt there should be a discussion of how parking management relates to achieving the goal of",
      "promoting transit. Mr. Schiller feels the TAC should have a discussion at how parking",
      "management can help achieve the transit goals. The rest of the TAC did not agree, as this was",
      "not a direct focus of the TIP and tabled the discussion.",
      "Ms. Shocket asked if there were any other comments and there were none.",
      "8. Other Business \u2013 for discussion",
      "Mr. Stuart thanked Mr. Baudouin who had taken the lead to put together a committee",
      "regarding the Providence Train Station which has been inadequately maintained over the years.",
      "Mr. Stuart stated that there will be a meeting on Monday, June 4 at 3:30 p.m. which will be co-",
      "hosted by the Coalition for Transportation Choices. Steve Devine of RIDOT and VHB the",

      "on behalf of the RI Association of Railroad Passengers he wanted to thank all staff regarding",
      "their diligent work on the TIP.",
      "Mr. Therrien stated that RIPTA is undergoing a Comprehensive Operations Analysis of its bus",

Commissioner DiPaolo expressed concern of the 2% rate increases for all staff, including union hourly personnel. She wanted to know how we justified giving rate increases when Resource Recovery will be down $6M in 2013. OConnell states he believes there should be a reward for good personnel and if affects the morale a great deal. Commissioner Rhodes compares RIRRC's employees to state workers, OConnell says it's not accurate to compare when state employees work 35 hours a week with a number of benefits while employee here work 40+ hours with none of the additional benefits state employees receive. OConnell believes that it is a wrong decision not to move forward with the 2% rate increase, Commissioner Rhodes suggested maybe a 1.5% increase as a possible option and that the state is not granting a raise this year. The commissioners requested a historical review of increases at the quasi's for the last five years.

      "LDQ: They understood the safety issue.",
      "DR: Steve I think when you take a look at that redlined version you",
      "should sit down with your members of the glass industry to keep",
      "everybody involved.",
      "SA: I have a lot of concerns. In the wintertime you get a lot of these",
      "guys who are putting in glass in ways that they shouldn\u2019t be. What is",
      "happening is the urethane is not bonding properly which puts the",
      "customer at risk. Originally there was a requirement to have a facility",

      "hazard to public safety in installation of glass in weather conditions",

      "SA: We can get you paperwork on any urethanes. But bottom line is",
      "when it comes out of the gun in 5 degree climate it will not cur",
      "properly because it says it should dry at a certain temperature",
      "minimum. The lowest I have seen is 40 or 50 degrees.",
      "DR: We have had people in from the mobile shops in to testify to the",
      "fact that they have urethane that will cure outside at 10 degrees in",
      "45minutes? I actually consulted I-car and P&O consultants out of NY.",

      "DG: What is the time frame that a person should not drive the car",
      "after an installation?",
      "SA: I tell them at least 24 hours. If someone is going to drive a short",
      "distance we can put some tape on it but they are really suppose to",
      "park them.",
      "DG: That is a structural part of the car.",

      "of the day.",

      "changed your point of view.",

      "business.",
      "DR: There are going to be some measures that they have to adhere",
      "to.",

      "customer is not driving an unsafe vehicle.",
      "GG: I have a question on insurance matters. Will the insurance",
      "companies potentially have to pay for another window if a mobile",
      "shop put a window in and it pops out or has a problem and its",
      "damaged?",
      "DR: The insurance company maintains no responsibility to do it over",
      "again. It\u2019s the vendor who puts the glass in and is solely responsible",
      "for the liability and the re-installation if it is necessary.",
      "SA: Are insurance companies making sure a licensed company is",
      "working on the vehicle?",

      "the dings. Not replace windshields.",
      "DG: The cracks?",
      "KP: Yes, I think we have to define mobile repairs compared to",
      "mobile installation and replacement.",
      "DG: A limited license.",
      "KP: Glass is already called a limited license. We need to give it",
      "another title.",
      "DG: They are not working with the structure of the vehicle.",
      "DR: We definitely need a standard here.",
      "LDQ: Standards for what you can do inside and what you can do",
      "outside.",
      "DR: We can probably incorporate in the regulation where it defines",
      "the repair process for the chip and scratch process.",
      "LDQ: So you are either an installer or repairer.",
      "DG: Wholesale in my opinion means you are putting yourself out to",
      "the trade not the public. You can\u2019t just close down a business that",
      "has been opened for 36 years.",
      "DR: To give a little they would have to give some type of agreement",
      "that he has a license with a facility and he has some type of",
      "documentation that if I have to put glass in and it is 10 degrees out. It",
      "could be grandfathered to the people that are already pre-existing.",
      "So anybody new comes in has to come up with the space",
      "requirement.",
      "DG: Can I make a recommendation because it is going to effect",
      "approx 15 or so businesses can we send mobile guys a letter to come",
      "to next meeting.",
      "LDQ: Sure",
      "DG: Maybe they will be receptive. We have to respect all of them. I",
      "bet out of 29 there are about 7 or 8 of them that do scratch and chips.",
      "DR: Steve and Dennis. Put some stuff on paper because we all know",
      "what we are looking for now. And come up with something.",
      "LDQ: Send the draft to me.",

      "Motorcycle collision repair discussion",
      "DR: Motorcycle collision repair. When do they need a license? It is a",
      "special use license. Guidelines are not there specifically. I have",
      "copies of all the notes and letters from when we originally discussed",
      "licensing.",
      "DG: Why did this come up now?",
      "DR: We can\u2019t be specific we need to go into executive session.",

      "been in an accident in order to evaluate it and deal with an insurance",
      "company you have to have a body shop license.",
      "LDQ: Absolutely.",
      "DR: Al, do you require motorcycle repair guys to have a license?",
      "LDQ: It is broad. Motor Vehicle body needs to be improved.",
      "DR: Self propelled.",
      "KP: If that is the definition we are going to go with we might need to",
      "call in shops like we did with the RV\u2019s to find out exactly what they",
      "do.",
      "DR: Even with the RV\u2019s and not to be specific, when it was in a",
      "collision and they had an insurance company involved, the person",
      "who is doing the repair has to have a certain amount of expertise to",
      "determine if the vehicle has any structural damage because it does",
      "have a frame underneath it and suspension and it does have a drive",
      "train. That stuff does have to be evaluated correctly in order to put",
      "the customer on the road safely. I know with motorcycles it is pretty",
      "much a cut and dry situation. If the chassis is damaged in any way",
      "you need to replace it. You do not straighten chassis on motorcycles",
      "but unless that person has some type of certification how are you",
      "supposed to be capable of distinguishing if it is or it isn\u2019t bent. I am",
      "sure an insurance company is not going to want to just start",
      "replacing things on face value.",
      "DG: So can a full collision type of body shop license work on a",
      "motorcycle?",
      "DR: Absolutely.",
      "KP: Would a frame get bent in any other type of way besides a",
      "collision?",
      "DR: Yes. You can hit a pothole. Lets come back next session with",
      "papers and convene into Executive session. Most of the time they",
      "are not repairable.",
      "DR: Any other questions. Does anyone have a public comment or",
      "concern?",
      "DG: I sent a letter to Paula Pallozzi in reference to a couple of",
      "appraisal firms that I have been asking to leave me a copy of the",
      "estimate. So she monitored it for me.",
      "DR: That is in direct conflict to regulation 15 the one we put together",
      "there are provisions and penalties to appeasers that do not comply.",
      "So I am sure Paula is aware of it.",
      "DG: She will let me know. I sent out letters to two companies. The",
      "next batch is going out next week. If you can\u2019t come prepared let the",
      "insurance company know. Some of these cars are 2 or 3 days to",
      "repair I have to hold the car over the weekend.",
      "DR: Any other questions? Asked John how he is making out on",

      "Present: First Warden Kimberley H. Gaffett, Second Warden Raymond J. Torrey, Town Councilor Peter B. Baute, Town Councilor Kenneth C. Lacoste and Town Councilor Richard P. Martin. Also present were Town Manager Nancy O. Dodge, Town Solicitor Katherine Merolla, consultant Richard LaCapra and Waste Water Inspector Donald Thimble. Town Clerk Fiona Fitzpatrick took the minutes of the meeting. First Warden Gaffett called the meeting to order at 7:00 p.m.",
      "1. Administrative Hearing for violations of the New Shoreham Wastewater",
      "Management Ordinance (Chapter 19, Article VII) and Zoning Ordinance Sec. 506:",
      "failure to repair or replace failed, steel septic tank - J. Pinney, Plat 8, Lot 109",
      "The First Warden called the hearing to order at 7:00. Mr. Pinney was not present and did not send a representative to the hearing. Wastewater Inspector Donald Thimble testified the steel tank became noncompliant in 2003 when the ordinance was changed. Mr. Pinney was issued a first and second notice of violation in 2008 under the former ISDS ordinance. At that time the Town solicitor determined the Sewer Commission did not have a clear ability to levy fines. The ordinance was revised in 2008 and 2009 and in March, 2012 the Town Council was empowered to hear appeals and levy fines. Mr. Thimble reissued first and second notices of violation under the new ordinance. Mr. Thimble answered questions. He said he believed it is the last steel tank in use on Block Island. The tank did not appear to be leaking at the time of the most recent inspection in October 2011. Mr. Pinney had until 2003 to replace the tank. He is living in the house. Dr. Baute suggested giving Mr. Pinney until June 7 to replace his substandard inadequate tank, then fine him $50 per day. Ms. Gaffett suggested giving him until July 1 to submit an application to DEM. Mr. Thimble said Pinney will have to hire engineer for soil evaluation, groundwater depth and system design. Plans are submitted to the Town, then the RI DEM. DEM approval will take about four weeks, and about four weeks for installation. Discussion ensued. Dr. Baute moved to give Mr. Pinney until July 1, 2012 to submit an application to the DEM, and to give him two weeks after DEM approval to show the Wastewater Inspector proof that he has hired a contractor to install the system, and to levy fines of $50 per day if the deadlines are not met; and to review the status at the Town Council\u2019s next meeting. Motion was seconded by Mr. Martin. Ayes: 5 (Gaffett, Torrey, Baute, Lacoste, Martin) Nays: 0",
      "2. Act on Energy Savings Program Recommendations from Johnson Controls",
      "Present were Jim Cotton, Johnson Control Incorporated (JCI) Area General Manager, and Aaron Albion, Project Manager. Washington County Regional Planning Council Executive Director Jeff Broadhead and Engineer Dave Ward who represents the interests of the Town and WCRPC were also present. Dr. Baute said he believed some of the building sizes and hours of operation used by JCI were not accurate. Discussion ensued of Dr. Baute\u2019s recommendations from JCI\u2019s menu:",

      "\u2022 Simple thermostats will be considered",
      "\u2022 No one was present from the BI School. The Trane HVAC system was discussed; Dr. Hicks reportedly needs more detail but will possibly sign on for a new kitchen hood. The 16 year payback for insulation did not seem worthwhile.",

      "\u2022 Dr. Baute said the 21,060 hour per year for Library operation appeared to be reasonable. Lighting retrofits, weatherization, computer management and water saving are possible but the projected saving is low. Possible savings related to the heating/cooling control system interface may be feasible pending a report from Ward. Discussion ensued regarding dehumidifiers. Lighting retrofit can be added.",
      "\u2022 JCI provided combined figures for the Police Station and Fire Barn. Dave Ward explained the buildings cannot be treated separately because the electrical circuits are crossed and there is a single boiler. The single boiler was disputed. Because Council members are considering that the Fire Barn may be replaced in three to five years, they were not in favor of long term retrofits to the building.",
      "\u2022 Dr. Baute said the plans for the Water Plant were fairly straightforward and he requested Superintendent Simmons look at the suggestions.",
      "\u2022 Health Services: Dr. Baute said the lights in the basement need sensors. The reestimation for attic insulation is $2,970 dollars.",
      "The next step is to develop a list of action items and get documentation for hours of operation, etc. to revise estimates. The Council will then chose projects.",

      "5(a)(5) for discussions related to acquisition or lease of property for public purposes]",
      "The first part of the discussion was held in open session. The Town\u2019s expert Richard LaCapra and Deepwater Wind Project Manager Bryan Wilson were present. Mr. Wilson said the documents provide for two separate easements for the two cables: Block Island Transmission System (BITS) is the transmission cable from the mainland to Block Island. The other easement is for the cable from the BI Windfarm. The cable from Narragansett and the cable from the wind farm will come together at the Town Beach and travel together to the substation at BIPCo. Half the substation will be owned by BITS and half owned by Deepwater Wind. Ms. Gaffett said the Council will enter closed session with Attorney Merolla and Mr. LaCapra to discuss negotiation strategies for the long and short term leases. She said no decisions will be made. The decision on the easements will be taken in the future when the topic is on an agenda. At 8:40 First Warden Gaffett moved to enter closed session pursuant to RIGL 42-46-5(a)(5) for the discussion of acquisition or lease of public property, seconded by Mr. Lacoste. Ayes: 5 (Gaffett, Torrey, Baute, Lacoste, Martin) Nays: 0 Mr. Wilson and the rest of the audience left. At 9:55, Ms. Gaffett moved to come out of closed session and seal the minutes. Motion was seconded by Mr. Torrey. Ayes: 5 (Gaffett, Torrey, Baute, Lacoste, Martin) Nays: 0 Ms. Gaffett announced no motions were made in closed session.",

      "Meeting Minutes",
      "Attendees: Mike McGiveney, Robert Rheault, Marta Gomez-Chiarri, Bill Silkes, Mark Gibson, Alisa Richardson, Kevin Cute, and David Beutel --Discussion regarding two new national permits that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is intending to issue concerning the discharge of water from vessels. The permits are called Vessel General Permit (VGP) for non-military and non-recreational vessels greater than 79 feet, and small Vessel General Permit (sVGP) for non-military and non-recreational vessels less than 79 feet. The primary concern is for the requirements for the federal permit to discharge ballast water and the potential for exposure to invasive species to Rhode Island. --DEM Office of Water Resources must comment by June 30, 2012 on state certification of federal permit --There is an effort for coordinated responses from the Northeastern states, prompted by New York. New York is proposing more strict standards than the EPA has proposed. --VGPs are renewed every 5 years --Discussion regarding the 4 points below from New York",
      "Relative to AIS, NY is requesting that conditions similar to the conditions stated below, be placed into as many State 401\u2019s as possible. They are:",
      "1. A 100x IMO discharge standard but deferred until the next VGP (likely 2018), pending an evaluation of the commercial availability of suitable technology.",
      "2. Requirements for mandatory ballast water exchange even if you have installed a ballast water treatment system (allowing for a combination of practices to achieve the standard).",
      "3. Live organism monitoring \u2013 currently compliance is measured by measuring Enterococci, treatment system residuals and physical inspection of the treatment system. No mechanism is currently in place to sample live organisms like phytoplankton and zooplankton which could be a biosecurity threat to the aquatic environment.",
      "4. Prohibit the discharge of bilge water",
      "--Biosecurity Board members present agreed with bullet one discharge standard on the 2018 timeline; agreed with the continued mandatory ballast exchange before entering the EEZ; had concerns with bullet three in terms of enforcement, but agreed conceptually; and disagreed with bullet four as an undo burden on the fishing industry --The oyster disease SSO situation was briefly discussed and agreed that it will need further examination in July. --Meeting adjourned"

      "I. Call to Order \u2013 Lt. Governor Roberts called the meeting to order at 2:00pm, thanking everyone for taking time out of their schedules during this busy time of year. Began the day\u2019s discussions.",
      "II. Update \u2013 Healthcare Reform Commission 2012 Work Plan Update \u2013 Jennifer Wood, Office of the Lt. Governor presents (slides available upon request).",
      "Questions/Comments /Clarifications a. Lt. Governor Roberts: Can you speak to what the Second Gate Review",
      "is? i. Jennifer Wood: Continued authorization of federal funds to develop the exchange, and it is a check in with our partners to ensure the state is on track.",
      "b. Commissioner Koller: This idea of updating every month is really great, may I just suggest a formal canvassing of the representatives and the staff of the executive committee to include in these updates.",
      "i. Jennifer Wood: Great, will do thank you very much.",
      "III. Health Workforce in the Context of Healthcare Reform -\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090 Jennifer Wood, Office of the Lt. Governor. [Presentation slides available upon request]",
      "Questions/Comments/Clarifications a. Jennifer Wood: Before we get started would like to specially thank",
      "Tricia Leddy with OHHS for her assistance in gathering all this data. b. Lt. Governor: Normally we hold off for public engagement until after",
      "the meeting, but if there are members of the audience who have questions or comments about a slide, I welcome them to ask or comment as we move through the presentation as opposed to simply waiting until the public comment portion of the agenda.",
      "c. Secretary Costantino: How do you define density? i. Jennifer Wood: As a percent of state population. ii. Secretary Costantino: It is density of primary care physicians? iii. Jennifer Wood: Yes.",
      "d. Dr. Fine: Who counts as a primary care physician through this calculation?",
      "i. Tricia Leddy: I would have to find the data sources \u2013 usually it is the internal medicine that is the sway. Some of the other",
      "slides are other sources, all the numbers are not going to be the same as agencies count differently, but it is telling us more where we are relatively.",
      "ii. Dr. Fine: There is no good correlation between sort of generic primary care physicians and general physicians \u2013 I would be interested to see that number extracted in a way that is comparable, and those are the gender study from 2003 and the a study from 1998 or 1999.",
      "iii. Tricia Leddy: This would be great to add other data to this. iv. Jennifer Wood: The purpose of today\u2019s discussion is to give",
      "enough general information to the executive committee and informed by the dialogue from the audience today is to take a scan and then dig into what we need to look at going forward. These first few slides are to show that vis a vis the nation we are not the worst in the nation, but we have to see where we are in all this.",
      "e. Commissioner Koller: Is there an anecdotal sense of where specialists are? Are we to the right on specialists as we are to primary care docs?",
      "i. Jennifer Wood: Let\u2019s get to that if we can, and we can discuss later in the presentation.",
      "f. Ed Quinlan, Hospital Association: Is there any data available that distinguishes licensed PCP vs. not practicing?",
      "i. Jennifer Wood: We will ask that question with each group. ii. Lt. Governor Roberts: I don\u2019t believe we have a good way of",
      "figure out best way to handle. g. Lt. Governor Roberts: Scope of practice -\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090 that is particularly relevant",
      "in terms of nurse practitioners, who by license can take on a lot of the responsibilities that primary care physicians would.",
      "h. Dr. Fine: A look at the literature put out by the Dept. of Health last summer, which is available in the room today, does look at the relationship between cost and outcome and supply. The literature isn\u2019t overwhelming but it is a layout of what we have thus far.",
      "i. Ed Quinlan: do the higher education institutions have data to share now that they are launching their programs?",
      "i. Jennifer Wood: We haven\u2019t reached out to request that as yet, but will do so following that suggestion.",
      "j. Secretary Costantino: Over the years we have had a shortage of different groups of health care professionals, where does that fall in these?",
      "i. Jennifer Wood: There are much larger categories than PCPs that we have not delved into today.",
      "ii. Secretary Costantino: On the workforce development side are we just looking at PCPs or are we looking beyond?",
      "iii. Jennifer Wood: Yes. We are looking for guidance and focus from this group today to see where we are now.",
      "k. Commissioner Koller: To that end, I would suggest that the order of this is important (practice models) I would put Teams first. What is the configuration of primary care teams \u2013 if you put that first then other things fall from that. Looking ahead, you introduced patient centered medical home, and I think that may be an idealized team for that would be helpful. Start with structure and build from there.",
      "l. Dr. Fine: There are two things worth noting. One is the breadth of the team in terms of disciplinary nature, and what it does? The second is the training part of the team, and working together as a team. Access and hours of access. The last piece is practice models that are more or less population based \u2013 whether they are truly focused on the health of the population or more focused on episodic care.",
      "m. Secretary Costantino: Sometimes we look at healthcare outside of the way we ask other economic development questions. Have we ever asked why people want to work in RI? Is it something about RI that draws them in \u2013 tax policy, public education system etc., beyond loan forgiveness, beyond reimbursement \u2013 why do they work here?",
      "i. Lt. Governor Roberts: Often it\u2019s that there is family here. I think the medical society has surveyed their members as to why they are here.",
      "1. Jennifer Wood: One of the areas that some of the health care visionaries that have come to address us is that if we can re-\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090align the environment so that businesses want to work here it helps to build the industry as well. Making healthcare more affordable or employer friendly may help with that.",
      "ii. Ed Quinlan: To attract and retain physicians in the state, reimbursement is key.",
      "iii. Lt. Governor Roberts: We haven\u2019t been able to recruit oral surgeons either \u2013 but the newest one I have spoken to in the state is that his wife is from here; not our reimbursement rate.",
      "iv. Commissioner Koller: But I think you need to break that statement down, we are leveling out on that as a state. As a percentage of Medicare we are competitive with MA \u2013 in part of primary care. We are not in other areas.",
      "v. Secretary Costantino: Does a nurse make more in MA, does a physician assistant, what are the others? Are we competitive?",
      "vi. Commissioner Koller: We cannot be competitive in every area, with every provider, we do need to pick the areas we will be competitive in, but it is something to look at.",
      "n. Dr. Fine: Was the task force cognizant of the likely supply of geriatric specialists and did they make those recommendations separate and distinct from primary care specialists?",
      "i. Jennifer Wood: My recollection is that it was a separate inquiry, which brings us to the next group which is workforce training across the Board.",
      "o. Secretary Costantino: As we make change to the priorities how do we integrate these to the programs the state is moving forward?",
      "i. Lt. Governor Roberts: Right, we don\u2019t want this to be done separate from the other work that we doing in RI. If we do this in the absence of broader economy policy groups, then we are not doing our job well.",
      "ii. Jennifer Wood: Part of the impetus for doing this now is that there are efforts starting that do require knowledge of workforce needs, but they have old information.",
      "IV. Discussion of Participants and Partners a. Commissioner Koller: One environmental piece we may want to take a",
      "look at, I hear there is to be a bond this week about nursing and it would seem that tying",
      "i. Jennifer Wood: Higher Ed and training pipeline participants. ii. Commissioner Koller: Yes and making sure things like this",
      "bond items and common informs work that is being done. b. Secretary Costantino: Often we do not discuss is what is coming out of",
      "the schools \u2013 whether it be nursing, dentists, etc. \u2013 are the folks who are being hired satisfied. Quality of training vs. quantity. I think we have to at least have the folks who are doing the hiring have some place to weigh in on what they are looking for.",
      "c. Lt. Governor Roberts: Absolutely \u2013 industry, what hospitals are looking for etc.",
      "d. Amy Zimmerman: There is a lot of money in terms of health IT that have gone into workforce development, and ways that healthcare providers need to use technology. There are grants etc. from NE Tech and Healthcentric Advisors to allow different levels of providers to use technology.",
      "i. Lt. Governor Roberts: How we adequately train people in mid career for the new challenges, whether it is how you integrate technology into your practice, how you access electronic medical records etc., and who are our partners in that.",
      "ii. Amy Zimmerman: And also the innovation applicants all had to include workforce component may be worth looking at.",
      "e. Stacy Paterno: When we think about workforce development and folks working to the top of their license, there are regulatory issues in a way that sometimes prohibit folks from doing what they are hoping to or could. How do we do this in a timely way or adjust that so that individuals can practice to the top of their license.",
      "f. Shawn Donahue: Believe that you do need to have insurance providers in this conversation as well. We can be very helpful in this world as well.",
      "i. Lt. Governor Roberts: I agree, and believe they can be involved in two ways, knowing the limits and the expanse.",
      "g. Dr. Fine: We should also look outside of RI. Engineer a workforce that does not exist, perhaps look around the country at states that have good health outcomes and see what their workforce roles are. I think the danger is that if we bring in the usual players who have done what they have in the past it may be a duplication of efforts as opposed to something new and fresh and useful.",
      "h. Secretary Costantino: Outcomes are extremely important, and as I look at some of the programs we fund, we put a lot of money into training and get poor results. A portion of that is our large unemployment rate. We are looking at the way we train people and individuals, and we are looking at more innovative ways. We tend to give a lot of money to a nonprofit agency that will train a lot of people for a certain sector. Look at different models of training to ensure we can look to outcomes.",
      "i. Jennifer Wood: I do see some emphatic head nodding to that point around the room, indicating consensus.",
      "i. Jennifer Wood: what is not on this list that should be \u2013 on the RI Priorities list.",
      "i. Dr. Fine: Service delivery standards for practices. We know what we are asking the practices to deliver ten we can engineer a team that lets us deliver that product.",
      "ii. Commissioner Koller: Need to define how patients/consumers engage the delivery system. Assuming that they shop, assume that people will self-\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090assign? There are several factors that we need to put as in scope or outside of scope. Assumptions around employer-\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090based health insurance are going to be important as people are always looking in a third party health insurance system as well. For whatever group is looking at this give an assumption to help identify there.",
      "iii. Dr. Fine: There are some people who have argued that a PCP is performing adequately when 90% of the people in the area what to use it, and that is a high expectation. I think we need to look at the third leg of the triple aim.",
      "iv. Jennifer Wood: I think we need to develop some proposals, have this group deliberate on what the charge is (short, medium and long term) and then hand down that charge to the work group.",
      "1. Lt. Governor Roberts: We need to look at what our system looks like.",
      "2. Commissioner Koller: We just have to define what is in scope and what is out of scope.",
      "3. Jennifer Wood: We want the products and the deliberations of the work group to be useful.",
      "4. Lt. Governor Roberts: I think the idea of long-\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090term challenges and objectives are key also. What is achievable now and what is achievable later.",
      "j. Next Steps: i. Lt. Governor Roberts: Transforming the existing work group into something more effective and high level.",
      "ii. Secretary Costantino: If we were to go to the governor\u2019s workforce board, and say we want it a work group under that, is that what we are seeking? Do we want to meld?",
      "iii. Lt. Governor Roberts: We want to do more than the mission of that organization. We do want Rick Brooks fully engaged, but I am not sure that we want to say create a subcommittee whose job is this. We want to transform the existing work group under the Healthcare Reform Commission.",
      "1. Secretary Costantino: Just want to be sure we loop them in.",
      "2. Jennifer Wood: I have a meeting set up with Rick Brooks to try to get the ball rolling on this, have a conversation about this to ensure the two do not head in different directions.",
      "iv. Commissioner Koller: I am having a hard time extracting the work suggested here from the work of coordinated health planning. Now we are talking about maybe two or three interrelated efforts, can we consolidate it?",
      "1. Lt. Governor Roberts: Do you want to take this on? The challenge here is who will actually make it happen in the next year or so. There has been a lot of great work done in the past, but we need to get actual work forward.",
      "2. Secretary Costantino: I would suggest we get the co-\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090chairs and chairs of all these three efforts (governor\u2019s workforce board, executive committee and coordinated health planning) in a room and decide where it would be best for this to sit and have it be effective.",
      "3. Lt. Governor Roberts: Another piece is that a lot of this is not inside government, it is done by the industry itself, and how do we impact the industry while using all available resources.",
      "v. Ed Quinlan: Center for Health Professionals at HARI has existed for a while, and there is a workforce group with over 50 individuals on it that has met continuously over the years and we would be happy to share this. I would also posit that the board of nursing and the medical licensure should be included and consulted in this.",
      "vi. Commissioner Koller: Is it focused primarily on staffing as related to hospitals? Ed Quinlan: No, all health professionals. Craig Syata: The center has its own board, it is not a HARI directed organization; it provides administrative support, but it has its own board. It started off very nurse-\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090centric, but the",
      "plan is to have it evolve broader than just nursing. Lt. Governor Roberts: In fairness I will say I had just viewed it as a narrow focus organization so this is good to know, that it is looking more broadly.",
      "vii. Jennifer Wood: We will endeavor to review the notes, create a plan and return to this group.",
      "V. Public Comment \u2013 No additional comment put forward at this time. VI. Adjourn \u2013 Next meeting scheduled for June 11, 2012 at 2:00pm."

      "Mr. Milman asked Mr. Landry how much density bonus is being",
      "requested. He said that under the R40 base zoning, approximately six",
      "units could be built, seven with the inclusionary zoning density",
      "bonus.",
      "Mr. Landry said it is \u201cunfair\u201d to compare the compatibility of the",
      "project to the vacant land in the area.",
      "Michael Desmond, PE, of Bryant Associates, presented the results of",
      "the traffic study he completed. (Mr. Desmond\u2019s \u201cProfessional Profile\u201d",
      "was submitted as \u201cExhibit 4\u201d.)",
      "Mr. Desmond said George Street varies in width from 17 to 19 feet,",
      "and is 18 feet at the site. The speed limit is 25 mph. Responding to a",
      "question from the Planning Board, he said he did not know the width",
      "of the bridge/culvert on George Street to the east of the site.",
      "He described the report\u2019s findings in terms of accident history of the",
      "area, impacts on level of service, and compliance with the Town\u2019s",
      "off-street parking requirements. He said traffic patterns would be",
      "\u201cvirtually unchanged\u201d with the new development. He recommended",
      "tree trimming to improve sight distances in certain areas, and the",
      "addition of stop signs at the ends of George Street (though both of",
      "those locations are in Massachusetts).",
      "Mr. Moorehead described a revised site plan for the development,",
      "submitted as \u201cExhibit 5.\u201d Mr. Landry said they are not amending the",
      "application; the intent is to be \u201cconstructive.\u201d The revised site plan",
      "shows 24 dwelling units, with an open area on George Street, Mr.",
      "Moorehead said. Ms. Beckman described the planting plan for the",
      "revised plan.",
      "Several people spoke against the plan.",
      "Peter McCalmont of the Barrington Land Conservation Trust, who",
      "acts as steward of the Douglas Rayner Wildlife Refuge next door to",
      "the site, submitted and read from written comments. He said the",
      "proposal runs contrary to the Town\u2019s efforts over the years to protect",
      "open space in the George Street area, promote farming activities",
      "through land leases with Four-Town Farm, and protect wildlife with",
      "the recording of a conservation easement over 82 acres",
      "encompassing the Rayner Refuge and adjoining Town-owned land.",
      "Mr. McCalmont said the proposal is inconsistent with the 2009",
      "Comprehensive Plan, citing several sections including goals to",
      "protect natural areas in the Hundred Acre Cove area, promote farming",
      "and protect farmland, and adopt \u201cConservation Development\u201d zoning",
      "in the George Street area.",
      "Charlotte Sornborger, of the Land Trust, submitted a statement",
      "describing inconsistencies between the proposed development and",
      "sections of the Comprehensive Plan. She said the development would",
      "\u201cerase the rural character\u201d of an area that is one of the few remaining",
      "rural areas of Town. Ms. Sornborger referenced the habitat within the",
      "Rayner Refuge of the Diamondback terrapin, which she said is an",
      "endangered species. The proposed development, she said, is in",
      "conflict with the Comprehensive Plan\u2019s goals to promote agriculture",
      "in the George Street area, avoid impacts on the refuge, preserve the",
      "character of the area with the \u201cRural Residential\u201d Future Land Use",
      "Map designate, and limit light pollution impacts.",
      "Chris Clegg, of 4-Town Farm, asked whether the traffic study takes",
      "into account tractor traffic. He said the developer approached him",
      "about purchasing some abutting property owned by 4-Town Farm for",
      "house lots.",
      "Carrie Longo said she sold the property to North End Holdings with",
      "the understanding it would be developed into a \u201cfew beautiful",
      "homes,\u201d not a 27-unit townhouse development.",
      "Steve Clegg, of 4-Town Farm, said he is concerned that the septic",
      "systems could fail given a layer of clay he said is approximately 15",
      "feet below the surface in that area. He said the development could",
      "create drainage problems and potentially raise the water table on",
      "abutting land.",
      "Gene Martin, 10 George Street, Swansea, said it is his understanding",
      "the portion of George Street in Swansea is actually a paper road.",
      "The Planning Board decided not to waive the project review fee. Mr.",
      "Landry said he doesn\u2019t think a review of the master plan would be",
      "that informative, but suggested that it include both the 27-unit plan",
      "and the 24-unit alternate plan.",
      "Barbara Donovan, 12 Manning Drive, cited a need for senior housing,",
      "though she is not in favor of the George Street site.",
      "Ms. Sornborger questioned the analysis by the applicant\u2019s planner",
      "consultant that the development would add very few children to the",
      "school system, adding that the 15-foot-wide bridge could be a",
      "problem for school buses. Mr. Moorehead said the bridge is actually",
      "an 18-inch culvert.",
      "Mr. Moorehead said the wells would be 300 to 400 feet in depth, and",
      "the cisterns would be underground in concrete or reinforced",
      "fiberglass.",
      "Mr. McCormick said he is concerned about the proximity to the refuge",
      "of the proposed buildings on the westerly side of the site, which",
      "require a dimensional variance to be that close to the lot line. Mr.",
      "Moorehead said the setback from the wetland is more important than",
      "the setback from the refuge property. He said the conservation",
      "development model, promoted in the Comprehensive Plan, does not",
      "anticipate an increase in overall density, but added the alternate",
      "24-unit plan is in the \u201csame spirit.\u201d",
      "Mr. Adams said the \u201cstrongly negotiate\u201d comprehensive permits",

      "long-term plan of the Town.\u201d",

      "as amended.",

      "I. Call to Order: Lindsay McAllister called the meeting to order at 8:00am and welcomed the members to the meeting. She advised that today we would do a quick recap of where we have been thus far when discussing the Essential Health Benefits (EHB), and then looking to today\u2019s discussion of applying criteria and comparing benchmark plans.",
      "II. Presentation \u2013 Comparing Benchmark Plans [slides available on website and upon request]",
      "Questions/Comments Clarifications a. Kathryn Shanley: On the state plan for example, dental is sold",
      "completely separately, so should it be listed separately? i. Lindsay McAllister No\u2026 (inaudible response)",
      "b. Paul Block: The new autism coverage bill, how will that impact this? i. Lindsay McAllister That is only going to impact the large group market, not the individual.",
      "c. Kathryn Shanley: Is this based on affordability at today\u2019s premiums, which are reflecting the experience of the small group market, or is this adjusted at all?",
      "i. Lindsay McAllister Looking at what information is available to us publically. There will need to be a lot more discussion to have an actuarial analysis of the cost, this is looking at the benefit design to the extent that we know.",
      "d. Dawn Wardyga: Can you remind us of the timeline around this decision \u2013 looking at the information that we have now, and knowing we need more detailed information",
      "i. Lindsay McAllister The decision, we know, has to be made in Quarter three, but we do not have a specific date from the federal government as yet. There was some guidance from HHS two weeks ago having each of the benchmark plans submit the data we are discussing, but in that guidance there was not deadline for that data.",
      "ii. Dawn Wardyga: Then does that mean what this does is extends the time of this particularly work group?",
      "iii. Lindsay McAllister Yes today we are sharing an analysis of some of the plans, then we will detour to look at the dental and",
      "vision plans, then we will take a look at what we know on habilitative, at least our intent is to do so at this point. Then likely have one or two meetings after that to wrap up in August. Then there is a great amount of bringing along that we will need to take to the Executive Committee.",
      "iv. Dawn Wardyga: When we get to specific recommendations, which we will need by August, then we are still a bit impaired \u2013 is that true? I think it is important going forward we consider plans A, B and C that we can live with.",
      "v. Lindsay McAllister You raise a good point \u2013 we can only do so much with the information that is available to us. Given that information and the operating environment, we have to come to what are we comfortable coming to consensus on. It is difficult. It will be very helpful for HHS as they are helping the states to offer Qualified Health Plans, but as to EHB the guidance recently released was not as helpful as we had hoped.",
      "e. Elaina Goldstein: On the affordability point, I thought there was something in the law that says the premiums can only be a certain percentage of income. Does that cap the amount of money that we charge for a plan on the exchange?",
      "i. Lindsay McAllister No, I think that what you are getting at is more how individuals will access subsidies.",
      "ii. Elaina Goldstein: I thought there was a certain affordability income for those not getting a subsidy as well?",
      "iii. Lindsay McAllister In terms of the cost for the individual, it is a sliding scale, but it has nothing to do with a cap on the cost of a premium. It simply has to do with what your subsidy or tax credit would be and what your employer considers affordable.",
      "iv. Elaina Goldstein: If you do not get a subsidy then the plans on the exchange could be unaffordable.",
      "v. Dan Meuse: There is nothing that prevents the exchange from offering plans that are \u201cunaffordable\u201d to those not receiving a tax credit. There is not a limit on how much the premiums need to be, there is an understanding that to reach the goal of universal coverage, the most reasonable premiums possible would be a goal.",
      "f. Mark Deion: You identify including all state benefits, what happens if in future years the general assembly decides to legislate additional benefits? What will that mean for a state plan?",
      "i. Lindsay McAllister: At least initially, the look back to determine which mandates are included and what are not included is what was on the books by the end of 2011, at least for the first two years [2014 and 2015].",
      "ii. Mark Deion: That is in compliance with the feds, so does that mean the exchange prohibits the legislator from legislating?",
      "iii. Lindsay McAllister: No, but it adjusts the dynamic. Anything added after 2011 would be the state\u2019s fiscal responsibility. The percentage of cost in addition to the baseline benchmark plan, and beyond what wasn\u2019t on the books at the end of 2011.",
      "g. Brian Jordan: Prescription drugs, what is the coverage for that? i. Lindsay McAllister: It would need to be offered in reference to how the benchmark plans offers prescription drugs.",
      "ii. Commissioner Koller: All the benchmark plans cover prescription drugs.",
      "iii. Dan Meuse: The guidance we have received so far say that the copays are subject to plan design. As long as it covers the benefit, then differentials are fine. If the benchmark includes some sort of step therapy in the plan, then it would be required in the plan. The limits of the scope in those benefits.",
      "iv. Lindsay McAllister: It sets a floor. Say we chose United as the benchmark and it puts 20 visit limits on a given service, that is the floor If a plan were to go above that, since the benefits are incorporated into the plan along with the limits, anything above that may be the responsibility of the patient.",
      "v. Commissioner Koller: In terms of scope of drugs that are covered, think of what is covered and then think of how you get to it. It is a benefit design issue is more in the domain of the exchange, and the \u201cwhat \u201c that is covered, that is more in our scope right now.",
      "h. Unidentified Man: Formularies, the formularies are different, one drug might be a tier one or a tier three, and it gets confusing for the consumer. If there were formularies for this health plan, it would make it easier for the consumer.",
      "i. Commissioner Koller: It would, but that is unlikely. ii. Lindsay McAllister: One of the goals of the exchange is to",
      "present that kind of information in a fairly standardized way. i. Domenic Delmonico: How does HMO vs. PPO enter into this",
      "discussion? i. Lindsay McAllister: That is part of the plan design. ii. Commissioner Koller: I would argue that the HMO distinctions",
      "say a limited network is how you move from platinum to bronze. We hit that bronze target by only making that list available through that preferred list of docs, etc.",
      "iii. Domenic Delmonico: But it hangs between the two as it impacts affordability, doesn\u2019t it?",
      "iv. Commissioner Koller: Not really \u2013 yes an HMO would make this list of benefits more affordable, but we are assuming that reform will make this list of benefits hit the bronze level for the same set of costs. Otherwise all they have is cost sharing.",
      "v. Domenic Delmonico: Those plan designs are products thought?",
      "vi. Commissioner Koller: Yes, but only went to them for a list of what is covered.",
      "vii. Lindsay McAllister: What we are looking at is the level of what is covered and the calculation of actuarial value is something that we will have to work with our federal partners to establish. Ultimately that AV calculation goes into what we are providing consumers on the exchange, and deciding what their cost sharing would be.",
      "viii. Dan Meuse: We could hold a whole work group on actuarial values, as it is not just what you pay out of pocket, but also what the reimbursement rate is to the insurance company. All of the cost sharing across a benefit will be brought together, to get a single calculation for an entire plan.",
      "j. Steve Brown: Not sure all kids in RI are covered under RIte Smiles. At what age do they consider children\u2019s benefits?",
      "i. Diana Beaton: RIte Smiles goes up to 12, and the utilization of RIte Smiles may be lower than the general population.",
      "ii. Steve Brown: There might be differences between the RIte Smiles Plans and the Medicaid plan for children, to see what the differences are.",
      "iii. Lindsay McAllister Yes, but the guidance has been that our options are the CHIP program.",
      "iv. Kathryn Shanley: The benefits are the same up to the age of 21; it is the delivery system that is different. Up to 12 is RIte Smiles, 12 -\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u009021 is Medicaid.",
      "k. David Keller: In terms of considerations, it seems that because kids go through Medicaid and chip it would make sense to remind those advocates, so that kids do not lose out.",
      "i. Lindsay McAllister: That was something that was raised last time changes in our current environment, and churn as well.",
      "l. Elaina Goldstein: I feel this is the same discussion with habilitative services. I don\u2019t know if you are seeking additional clarification from HHS on this issue?",
      "i. Lindsay McAllister Beyond that parity should be offered along with habillitative, there has not been much guidance.",
      "ii. Dawn Wardyga: They have not been good about defining the differences between rehabilitative and habilitative.",
      "iii. Lindsay McAllister: We are hopeful that we will have more guidance to bring to the group.",
      "iv. Commissioner Koller: Once we get to the supplemental conversations, these questions of how do you supplement are not unique to RI, it would benefit all of us to learn how to derive more from this guidance that we have not yet picked up yet.",
      "III. Wrap Up:",
      "a. Commissioner Koller: Where we are headed with the benchmark plan, the take away is that there are not a ton of differences between the plans offered by the feds. We ask you to benefit from the learning, that the EHB decision does not have a whole lot of variation, not a huge driver of cost, and it make be that this is not the place to have a discussion of affordability, or to create something from scratch. The inclination right now is to go with the small group benefit plan. If people have thoughts or concerns, please convey that.",
      "IV. Public Comment: No additional Comment put forward",
      "V. Adjourn"

      "Minutes of the Meeting",
      "A Study Commission meeting was held in Room 313 of the State House, 82 Smith Street, Providence, Rhode Island on Monday, June 4, 2012. Rosemary Booth Gallogly, Director of Revenue and Chairperson of the Pension Study Commission called the meeting to order at 1:18 pm. Commission members present: Rosemary Booth Gallogly, Jean Bouchard, Paul Doughty, Allan Fung, Dennis Hoyle, J. Michael Lenihan, Richard Licht, Antonio Pires, Joseph Polisena, Steven St. Pierre, Andrew Marcaccio representing Gina Raimondo, John Simmons, and Angel Taveras Members absent: Bruce Keiser Others present: Susanne Greschner, Chief of the Division of Municipal Finance, Daniel Sherman from Sherman Actuarial Services, LLC and members of the public Agenda Item # 1 \u2013 Approval of Minutes from May 21, 2012 For the first item on the agenda Chairperson Booth Gallogly asked if the Commission members had any corrections, adjustments or additions to the draft minutes provided from the Study Commission meeting held on May 21, 2012. There were none. Mayor Polisena from the Town of Johnston made a motion to accept the minutes as written. The motion was seconded by Tony Pires, Director of Administration from the City of Pawtucket. The motion passed all in favor. Chairperson Booth Gallogly reminded the members of the public that the minutes from the Pension Study Commission are posted on the Division of Municipal Finance\u2019s webpage (http://www.muni-info.ri.gov/finances/study_commission.php) in case anyone is interested in seeing the progress that the Commission has made over the last several months. Agenda Item # 2 \u2013 Locally-Administered Pension Plans \u2013 Attachment B Next on the agenda, Chairperson Booth Gallogly introduced Dan Sherman from Sherman Actuarial Services, LLC and Susanne Greschner, chief of the Division of Municipal Finance to provide an update on the status of the locally-administered pension plans and discuss the analysis performed by Mr. Sherman and Ms. Greschner. The Chair noted that the municipal pension plan valuations which have been received by the Pension Study Commission have been evaluated by Mr. Sherman and a letter had been distributed to the communities to help the Commission understand where the communities stand with their experience studies and valuations and know which communities have adopted their experience study assumptions. To provide further clarification, another letter was sent to communities which included what tier each community\u2019s pension plan fell into in order to identify what follow up steps are necessary. The draft tiers can be found in Attachment B in the addendum.",
      "Page 1 of 5",
      "Ms. Greschner emphasized that the categorization was a work in progress and, as such, some communities\u2019 locally-administered pension plans have changed tiers from the last draft provided to the Commission. For example, Bristol, Newport Police & Fire and Portsmouth\u2019s pension plans were moved from tier 5 to tier 4. In addition, Westerly\u2019s pension plan was moved from tier 5 to tier 1 after the Department of Revenue received additional information from the town. According to Mr. Sherman, until recently, Westerly co-mingled their pension and OPEB assets. However, in March 2012, an OPEB trust was created to separate the assets and $4 million of OPEB assets was transferred to the pension plan. As a result, Westerly\u2019s pension plan assets increased (and the OPEB fund assets decreased) and the pension plan is no longer in critical status. Ms. Greschner indicated that upon receiving additional documentation from the communities, she anticipates that more pension plans will be moved out of tier 5. Mayor Taveras from the city of Providence informed Ms. Greschner that the city has accepted the assumptions of its experience study and that the city would provide her division with documentation stating such. Mayor Fung from the city of Cranston noted that Cranston expects to adopt its experience study assumptions on June 18, 2012. Furthermore, Ms. Greschner stated that her division is still working with the communities which have not submitted an experience study or submitted an incomplete one. Agenda Item # 3 \u2013 Funding Improvement Plan Guidelines \u2013 Attachments C & D For agenda item # 3, the Commission reviewed a revised draft of the funding improvement plan guidelines (Attachment C found in the addendum). Chairperson Booth Gallogly emphasized the need to receive standard data from the locally-administered pension plan administrators to be able to determine if an alternative funding plan submitted by is reasonable. In conjunction with that, Chairperson Booth Gallogly asked Mr. Sherman to walk the Commission through the table provided in Attachment D. Mr. Sherman stated that the purpose of Attachment D was to see if certain guidelines were to be set up, how difficult it would be for the locally-administered pension plans to meet them. Mr. Sherman acknowledged that some of the information he needed to create the table was hard to find in some of the communities\u2019 actuarial valuations so he made an educated guess in some instances. Therefore, his numbers in Attachment D may not match a city or town\u2019s actuary\u2019s numbers exactly, however, Mr. Sherman expressed confidence that the figures he used in Attachment D were close. Chairperson Booth Gallogly noted that if a community is not putting in as much money into a pension plan as it is taking out through pay-as-you-go then it will be hard to raise the funded ratio of the plan. Mr. Sherman added that there are two ways to affect the funded ratio of a plan: 1) by cutting liabilities or 2) increase funding. Chairperson Booth Gallogly noted that Mr. Sherman\u2019s table shows what contributions it would take for communities to meet their current pension obligations, however, it does not factor in any possible benefit changes communities may negotiate. Mr. Sherman noted that any affect on the annual required contribution (ARC) or pay-as-you-go depends on the type of benefits negotiated and if the changes primarily affect new employees, active employees or retirees. For example, relief from benefit changes to new or active employees will not be felt for many years. Furthermore, for communities on a pay-as-you-go basis, any benefit reductions negotiated with new or active employees will reduce the",
      "Page 2 of 5",
      "ARC however, the pay-as you-go contribution will not be reduced for several years so the gap between annual ARC payments and pay-as-you-go contribution will increase in the meantime. He noted that the tentative agreement between the mayor of Providence and the city\u2019s firefighters\u2019 union will reduce liabilities but not make a significant change to the pay-as-you-go contribution for several years. At that point, however, the reduction in pay-as-you-go will be significant. Director Licht inquired about the reduced amortization period used in Mr. Sherman\u2019s table. Chairperson Booth Gallogly responded that the reason a 25 year amortization period was chosen is because by shortening the amortization period, the amount of interest paid on the debt is reduced, thereby reducing the fund\u2019s liabilities and increasing the funded ratio. That way, a plan could emerge from critical status sooner. However, she acknowledged that it was a delicate balancing act between providing guidelines to help plans emerge from critical status sooner and having an affordable ARC. Mr. Sherman stated that Attachment D had multiple phases with the first being the priority of getting communities to fund 100% of their ARC. For communities who are not funding 100% of their ARC, Mr. Sherman proposed increasing their annual ARC payment by 20 percentage points per year until they reach 100%. Richard Licht, Director of Administration inquired if a city or town gets to 100% funding of its ARC would they still have to fund their pay-as-you-go amount? Mr. Sherman replied that would be the case only if the Commission put that in as a guideline. Chairperson Booth Gallogly added that funding the pay-as-you-go amount would help cities and towns get out of critical status earlier because they would not be drawing down the plan\u2019s assets. Mr. Sherman noted that the challenge is how to determine the pay-as-you-go minimum since communities don\u2019t know what the actual amount is until the year is over. One method for estimating pay-go includes using a percentage of the previous year\u2019s pay-as-you-go amount. Mr. Sherman noted that Attachment D does not factor in the employees\u2019 contributions to their pension which would affect the pay-as-you-go minimum per community. . John Simmons, executive director from the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council, asked what rate of return a community would use if using pay-as-you-go? Mr. Sherman responded that a community should go to their actuary and ask for a forecast of cash flows (benefits, employer contribution, and employee contribution forecasts) then go back to the investment house and redo the study based on the new cash flows to determine a new estimated rate of return. Chairperson Booth Gallogly asked if anyone knew if the state\u2019s pension reform ended up with a positive or neutral cash flow. No one did so she asked Andrew Marcaccio who was representing Gina Raimondo to follow up. In response to previous suggestions, Chairperson Booth Gallogly noted that the issue with simply applying the municipal employees retirement system (MERS) rules to locally-administered pension plans is that MERS rules are not aggressive enough due to the critical status of some municipal plans. Furthermore, she noted that Attachment D is provided to show how onerous emerging from critical status would be without any benefit changes. Director Licht stated that it would be helpful to see an alternative table which started with each community\u2019s current pension contribution and then escalate that contribution by 4% a year to see where the plan would be after 25 years because he is not sure that a 20% increase in ARC payments per year is realistic. In addition, he noted that there should be some discussion on benefit changes.",
      "Page 3 of 5",
      "Chairperson Booth Gallogly noted that the Division of Municipal Finance has compiled a report published on the Study Commission web page of the Division of Municipal Finance\u2019s website (http://www.muni-info.ri.gov/finances/) which compares employee benefits by municipality, however, she thinks it would be too difficult to quantify what a specific benefit change would have on each municipality\u2019s plan. For that, a municipality would need to rely on their actuary. Mayor Polisena from the Town of Johnston expressed concern about the Pension Study Commission setting guidelines because if a community is unable to successfully negotiate a reduction in benefits with its unions then what will the city or town do? For example, the mayor stated that he was told that one of the Johnston firefighters told the fire chief that, \u201cthe mayor better sell one of the schools to pay the firefighters\u201d. For the record, Mayor Polisena indicated that he is not going to sell a school. Paul Doughty, President of Providence\u2019s Local 1651 Firefighters union, stated that it should be up to the locals to come up with a solution. Further adding that if the state gets into managing local benefits then the Commission will never finish this discussion. He believes that the people who are in the best position to discuss benefits are those who have a vested interest. Therefore, he does not see the benefit of the Commission tracking down the benefits from all cities and towns because, in the end, he thinks the guidelines will resemble close to what the Commission has now. Chairperson Booth Gallogly thanked Mr. Doughty for his comments and said that she felt his words were encouraging. John Simmons suggested that the Commission look at the increase in proposed ARC payments in context with what proportion it represents of a city or town\u2019s tax levy, payroll, and budget, etc. Chairperson Booth Gallogly thought it would be a good idea to look at it in context and make people aware but she wants to be clear that the Commission is not advocating that an increase in tax dollars be required to fund the pensions, but that there could be a reduction in the liability through benefit reductions. Mr. Doughty further noted that while it is laudable to get a pension plan to the point where a municipality annually contributes 100% of its ARC, he is more concerned about the trend of funding status improvement rather than requiring cities and towns to reach 100% funding of their ARC within a certain timeframe. Mr. Sherman responded that he understands Mr. Doughty\u2019s point, however, funding improvement in a timely manner is critical for some plans. For example, West Warwick only has five (5) years until the plan\u2019s assets are exhausted. To follow up on the funding improvement plan in Attachment C, Chairperson Booth Gallogly requested that Mr. Sherman provide an example of what documents the Commission is considering requesting would look like using East Providence as an example. The Chair noted that it was important to get the guidelines out to the communities this summer so they and their actuaries have them when formulating their alternative funding improvement plans. She added that the goal is to develop guidelines that will be sustainable at the end of the day. Chairperson Booth Gallogly stated that she wants a municipality to identify items that have to happen in order to make sure that the alternative funding improvement plan would work. Mayor Fung expressed concern over the wording, wondering how a municipality could provide assurance with so many different variables. Tony Pires, Director of Administration for the City of Pawtucket noted that he cannot predict what will happen in Pawtucket as the city is struggling to even address its structural deficit. He added that his city cannot tax its way out of this situation. He hopes that people understand this. Chairperson Booth Gallogly responded that it is best to have a collaborative effort amongst the",

      "Association Inc., asked the Council to maintain funding of $5,000 for",
      "R.S.V.P. under Grants and Contributions.",
      "Conservation Commission Chairman Paul Soares noted there is quite",
      "a discrepancy between the Budget Committee\u2019s recommendation and",
      "the Administration\u2019s recommendation for the Conservation",
      "Commission. He commented that there are no DEM grants available",
      "this year and the commission is totally dependent upon the town for",
      "maintenance of the Mendon Road park.",
      "Town Planner Robert Ericson spoke about the $4 million dollars",
      "invested in energy conservation at no cost to the taxpayers. He",
      "noted there are still other projects that need to be done; however, the",
      "Budget Committee\u2019s recommendation for a part of plant operations is",
      "less than the amount the town will be saving.",
      "Mr. Ericson spoke about the reduction of education funding. There",
      "are organizations that require attendance at workshops, such as",
      "DEM, and there now is no money to do that. The Town will be",
      "ineligible for some grants.",
      "Mr. Ericson was at a loss as to why advertising costs for his",
      "department was not in his budget but in the contingency fund.",
      "Mr. Ericson stated one of the Finance Department positions has been",
      "singled out for the last two years. Last year the Town Council tried to",
      "make this a one-half union position and one-half non-union position",
      "which created an impossible situation. This person will be taking on",
      "the added duties of energy accounting for the town and is definitely",
      "needed in the finance department.",
      "While gathering information on the number of employees, Mr. Yazbak",
      "believed that the offices upstairs at Town Hall were overstaffed by",
      "one-half person in the finance department and one-half person in the",
      "Administrator\u2019s department. He felt last year was an opportune time",
      "to combine positions into one because there was a vacancy and that",
      "recommendation was made. Mr. Yazbak suggested that, instead of",
      "threatening lawsuits, the administration come back to the Council",
      "with a plan to reduce the expenses. If that can be done, Mr. Yazbak",
      "was sure the Council would look favorably upon it.",
      "Finance Director Brian Silvia stated this budget proposal was the",
      "administration\u2019s plan.",
      "June 4, 2012",
      "Mrs. Charest wanted to clarify that the Council is not singling out any",
      "one person, it is staffing that is under consideration.",
      "Mr. Rapko asked the Council to give consideration to the",
      "Conservation Commission\u2019s request for funding.",
      "Budget Committee Chairman Paul Vadenais responded to comments",
      "about reduction in education/training funding. The Budget",
      "Committee felt the town should not be paying for continuing",
      "education for its employees if a certain certification is required to",
      "keep that job. It should be the employee\u2019s responsibility. In the past",
      "the town has paid for employees to get their education and some of",
      "those employees no longer provide service to the town.",
      "In regards to the energy savings, the Budget Committee based its",
      "reduction upon comments made by Mr. Ericson that the Johnson",
      "Control project was going to save the town $29,000 in energy costs.",
      "The $29,000 is guaranteed savings and the committee was never told",
      "it was going to be reinvested.",
      "On the position in the finance department, Mr. Vadenais stated the",
      "Budget Committee was never given a job description as to what the",
      "job entails.",
      "Mr. Silvia responded that the job description was asked for last year",
      "and was provided. It was not asked for this year.",
      "Mr. Ericson commented that the $29,000 was not the number that",
      "applied to the town municipal buildings. That project, for $421,000,",
      "included the two fire stations and the library. They helped the town",
      "get the grant by scoring points as a sub-state entity serving more",
      "than one community. If you take that out and if you take out the",
      "actual energy costs vs. maintenance costs and other variables, it",
      "turns out to be $15,000 to $15,500 that those buildings are actually",
      "saving. Therefore the number that was produced in that budget is",
      "lower than the actual savings. So instead of having money to",
      "reinvest, what do you do -- turn off the heat in December?",
      "MOTION by Mr. Yazbak, seconded by Mr. Zwolenski, and voted",

      "Langlois outlined the proposed use fees for the new Pavilion. A discussion followed regarding use fees as they pertain to nonprofit and Town events, and reimbursements due to the cancellation of events because of weather. Wood stated that security deposits should be reimbursed due to cancellations. Langlois inquired about the policy regarding the erection of temporary structures such as tents in the lawn area. Also discussed were possible fee adjustments for more expansive events, and food trucks.

June 23rd Grand Opening: Langlois stated the there would be two events that will occur simultaneously at the June 23rd Grand Opening; RE Discover and the Farmer\u2019s Market. Scott Rabideau raised the issue of traffic control. Langlois recommended that on days of major events, Tinkham lane should be made one-way, and identify areas of additional parking. Stillwater Mill Management: Langlois referenced the handouts for hydro seeding, lawn maintenance and irrigation improvements. There was a discussion considering the scope of the grassed area. Kravitz referenced discussions with Clock Tower and their interest in making improvements to the lot across the driveway (with the rock). It was agreed to focus on the main area encompassing $9,000 in hydro seeding and irrigation improvements. Wood stated that they would be complete within two weeks right. Langlois made a motion to expend up to $9,000 for the hydro-seeding and irrigation. Barr seconded the motion, and the motion was unanimously approved. Barr raised the question about future lawn maintenance. It was agreed that future lawn maintenance should go out to bid. Canoe Launch: Kravitz stated that RIDEM has authorized the Agency to proceed with the installation of the canoe launch. Kravitz stated that the installation of the canoe launch basically entails cutting a path to the river. Kravitz stated the Department of Public Works could probably do it due to limited ground cover. Barr made a motion to expend up to $3,000 for the canoe launch on Clear River. Brizard seconded the motion, and the vote in favor was unanimous. Discussion, consideration and action relative to the Downtown Pascoag Redevelopment District. Brizard inquired about maintenance of the various vacant lots including the Mobil Station, Main Street Lot, and former warehouse parking lot.

      "on RIPTA\u2019s recommendations to the Legislative Commission on",
      "Sustainable Transportation Funding. Maureen Neira distributed a",
      "handout detailing same and Mr. Odimgbe discussed the four",
      "recommendations: 1) in the FY 2013 budget include funding to begin",
      "addressing RIPTA\u2019s debt service, working to repay any future debt",

      "Mr. Odimgbe said that at the Commission meeting they touched on",
      "helping RIPTA with debt service but there is a misconception as to",
      "how much this will help us.",
      "Next Michael Lewis asked Ms. Neira to begin by walking the",
      "Committee through each line item in the FY 2013 Operating Budget",
      "Assumptions. He said the goal today is to get an understanding of",
      "the amount of the operating deficit and then determine how to",
      "address it. He said it is critical that we firmly establish the projected",
      "budget deficit because no additional revenue is coming to RIPTA.",
      "Ms. Neira began with the general overview on the first page which",
      "identified the FY 13 deficit as $7.8 million. Mr. Lewis asked if this",
      "amount included the carryover from FY 12 and was told it does not",
      "include the $1.4 million carryover, therefore the total deficit is closer",
      "to $9 million.",
      "Ms. Neira discussed the 3 revenue assumptions and said revenue is",
      "down $1.5 million from FY 12. She then discussed the 7 expense",
      "assumptions in more detail and answered questions relative to the",
      "average cost of benefits and salary per employee, OPEB contribution,",
      "fuel costs and reasonable lock-in rates.",
      "Next Ms. Neira gave an overview of account descriptions and the",
      "committee held discussion of our various fare structures and asked",
      "staff questions on the actual cost per customer, per ride, which varies",
      "by fare product, i.e., a UPass rider cost is different from a cash paying",
      "customer. A discussion of senior and disabled fares and the level of",
      "discount we provide for school service ensued. The CEO noted that",
      "RIPTA is mandated to provide a lot of service, (seniors and disabled)",
      "for which we are not paid and a lengthy discussion was held on our",
      "actual costs and how to address same. Following this discussion Mr.",
      "Lewis asked Mr. Therrien to send him the RI law on senior and",
      "disabled service.",
      "Ms. Neira listed and discussed in more detail each of the account",
      "descriptions numbered 1 \u2013 46 in the handout. Ms. Picchione",
      "commented on #14 Federal Reimbursement \u2013 Preventive Maintenance",
      "saying last year congress passed a bill allowing us to use $1 million",
      "of capital funds to offset fuel increases. Ms. Neira said this is already",
      "reflected in the budget.",
      "Next Ms. Neira discussed wages and full time equivalents (FTE) and",
      "how the reorganization had affected the FTE numbers. She then",
      "touched upon each of the account descriptions briefly. Mr. Lewis",
      "asked about ADA operating expenses and Mr. Williams asked if a list",
      "of overtime by job category existed. Ms. Neira said it did and he",
      "asked that she forward him this list.",
      "Ms. Neira said pages 8 \u2013 11 show the budgeted line items in dollar",
      "amounts and indicated that we began FY 2013 with a $10 million",
      "dollar deficit which is now at $8.8 million. She concluded the FY 2013",
      "operating budget assumption discussion by discussing the bond",
      "funding for buses.",
      "Next Ms. Neira discussed the Cash Flow Shortage and Amendment to",
      "Capital Replacement Fund. She began by going over the excel",
      "spreadsheet detailing the projected cash flow issues for FY 2013 and",
      "explaining how we use the revolving fund to keep up with our cash",
      "flow issues. Ms. Neira explained that the bank revoked RIPTA\u2019s line",
      "of credit in 2011 therefore she needs to borrow from the capital",
      "replacement fund now. A discussion was held regarding deficit",
      "spending, which the Committee is not in favor of. Messrs William and",
      "Lewis said people at the state budget need to understand that the",
      "cost savings RIPTA was able to implement were one time fixes and",
      "we will not be able to lower the deficit further in any significant way.",

      "Budget Assumptions. Ms. Picchione said the process began with a",
      "needs assessment, and department\u2019s submitting capital requests for",
      "new projects which get prioritized internally based on what we think",
      "we have in funds and then the assumptions are brought to Finance",
      "Committee and finally to the Board for an initial review and for",
      "approval in July.",
      "She said that last year we began doing a large spreadsheet with all",
      "projects and this PowerPoint document is the larger version of that",
      "spreadsheet Ms. Picchione discussed each of the following titled",
      "items and the subcategories and read aloud the short description for",

      "Ms. Neira said to keep in mind that all the capital dollars that can be",
      "used for operating funds, are being used as such. Mr. Odimgbe",

      "towards planning for the TIP.",

      "connector line item saying it is included as a place holder for later",
      "years and not for approval. Regarding borrowing from the capital",

Public Hearing: Proposed new Energy Component of New Shoreham\u2019s Comprehensive",
      "Community Plan Town Planner Jane Weidman was present and reported that the proposed Energy Component of the Comprehensive Plan has been fully vetted, as it spent a year and a half with the Island Energy Plan Committee and nine months with the Planning Board. She explained that once the component is adopted it becomes a policy of the Town, but must then be approved by RI Statewide Planning. She suggested convening a group in the fall to work on plan implementation and action plans. Attorney Eric DiMario and Planning Consultant Joseph Lombardo, both representing property owners on West Beach Road, suggested three changes to the Energy Component as follows:",
      "\u2022 On page 40 in the \u201cBackground\u201d section, remove the mention of the lots included in the Public Utility Zone on West Beach Road, as such mention of the site may jade the findings of a Wind Energy Conversion System (WECS) site feasibility study.",
      "\u2022 Enact a one year moratorium on issuing a building permit for a wind turbine.",
      "\u2022 Spell out the utility WECS application requirements and have a process in place to make an application for such.",
      "Planner Weidman noted that the information regarding the Public Utility Zone was in the background section only and to remove it would leave a large gap in the history regarding WECS. Dr. Baute noted that the Energy Plan states that a WECS feasibility study should be completed prior to applications and that, in itself, puts a potential WECS application years off in the distance. Ms. Gaffett stated that a moratorium is not properly before the Council tonight. She further stated that the Planning Board was recently charged with reviewing the WECS application process. From the audience, Arlene Tunney spoke in favor of a WECS moratorium.",

      "I. Call to Order \u2013 Chair Curran called the meeting to order at 1:00pm",
      "II. Administrative Update \u2013 Jennifer Wood gave the update, advising: This will be a new, continuous agenda item. Brief status reports on where things stand administratively. With the legislative session coming to an end the Governor will be prepared to announce the Exchange Director\u2019s appointment prior to the next meeting of this Board. We will also be providing materials in advance of the next meeting a dashboard of sorts with budgetary updates, etc. The federal funds as part of the development for the exchange are part of the Governor\u2019s budget so that we may continue forward. You are aware that the UHIP RFP is posted and making its way through the process. a. Linda Katz: The Exchange director does not need to be confirmed by",
      "the Senate? i. Jennifer Wood: No, because it is a Division Director position that is appointed by the Governor.",
      "b. Linda Katz: Legislation pending that includes a number of policy items that call for an analysis and return to the general assembly including the BHP analysis.",
      "i. Jennifer Wood: That is correct \u2013 we feel that is an important piece to keep out federal partners aware that we are serious about our work.",
      "c. Commissioner Koller: What is the budgetary expectation around staffing for the exchange.",
      "i. Jennifer Wood: The staffing has been discussed with the director as well as funding for five FTEs.",
      "III. Presentation \u2013 Selection of QHP\u2019s to Offer of the Exchange. Dan Meuse, Jon Kingsdale to present. (Slides available upon request and on the website.)",
      "Questions/Comments/Clarifications a. Director Licht: The same rules apply to be on the exchange as are",
      "applied to sell insurance in RI? i. Dan Meuse: Some rules would, but the work is to have some rules on the exchange be more specific. There are specific",
      "minimum criteria that specific QHP\u2019s have to meet. There is a floor, and there are currently discussions about how to set that floor. Would it be market-\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090wide, or is the floor different inside or outside the exchange 0 that is a topic.",
      "ii. Director Licht: Is the goal to increase the competitive marketplace, as that would benefit everybody? Some may argue that having more insurers may make things more competitive. The exchange may be a way to lure someone not currently in the market into the fold \u2013 do we think these rules can aid in that?",
      "iii. Dan Meuse: The affordability discussion was the primary discussion of the stakeholder group. The primary feedback from that group is that affordability is most important and that whatever the exchange can do and whatever the state may do to drive affordability should be of the utmost importance. The exchange by nature is meant to encourage competition, and with the exchange having a goal of favorably impacting cost trends, that would be a lens that this discussion should be viewed with at all times. What both the state regulatory offices are thinking about ad that we will ask the Board to consider is competition best met when there is a level playing field inside and outside the exchange and the exchange may set specific criteria for innovations that it wants to drive towards that are in alignment with other innovative ideas, proposal or efforts, so that we do not split the market and end of having folks that need to use the exchange walk away or have adverse impacts.",
      "b. Mike Gerhardt: Have we heard of any interest of anyone [insurers] coming into the state? If you have three carriers now, as anyone else expressed an interest in coming forward?",
      "i. Dan Meuse: There have been small entreaties into smaller populations, but not full out. The compromise on the public option was that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) would develop a multi state plan and that an insurance company would be required to offer a multi state plan on the exchange. That will therefore be a fourth player on our field that we already know about.",
      "c. Director Licht: In the many gap coverage places, national players are significantly less expensive than our state players offering the state product, as they have a much larger population.",
      "i. Commissioner Koller: Medigap model is an interesting one to look at.",
      "ii. Mike Gerhardt: People buy what is familiar. d. Tim Melia: Has the minimum criteria been set?",
      "i. Dan Meuse: In the last meting there was a long list that was very technical. There are 11 or 12 specific technical criteria, and we can provide that to the Board and show what the work",
      "product will be. Now RI is at the point that say we can add to it or not.",
      "ii. Tim Melia: Will there be waivers to those criteria, or will they need to stick strictly to the minimum criteria?",
      "iii. Dan Meuse: To my knowledge there are not opportunities to step below the minimum floor that is set. There are options to exceed that on one\u2019s on. Do not believe there are waivers to the QHP certification requirements.",
      "e. Secretary Costantino: As you look at that continuum, we have to decide where along that continuum is best for RI. If you had to categorize the pros and cons on the exchange, and the extremes, how would explain that.",
      "i. Dan Meuse: Coming up in future slides, but one way to think of this is what is best in year one, but then what is best in year two, or year five.",
      "f. Amy Zimmerman: So how often are you re-\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090qualifying plans? i. Dan Meuse: Theoretically it can be done on an annual basis . ii. Amy Zimmerman: Would that create a lot of churn? iii. Dan Meuse: Yes, and that is an important consideration.",
      "g. Mike Gerhardt: We have expert groups that look at these? i. Dan Meuse: The expert group pin discussing this had vocal brokers and agents who considered opening it up and allowing market determination was the only way to go. As we move towards the left the providers were more focused on ensuring there were specific criteria being met. The carriers have been less interested in more prescriptive models, generally speaking.",
      "ii. Mike Gerhardt: BCBS has been moving more in that. h. Linda Katz: It seems to me that there are a number of innovations on",
      "standards \u2013 there are not really innovations, that we would do, but rather growing off of existing work. My suggestion is to watch language perhaps. Not everything is an innovation, but rather an expansion of existing programs.",
      "i. Dan Meuse: That is an important distinction, you are correct, and one we should keep in mind.",
      "i. Mike Gerhardt: How many plans do you envision? i. Dan Meuse: We will be getting into that shortly. ii. Linda Katz: From the consumer\u2019s perspective, too much choice",
      "is no choice. j. Commissioner Koller: One of the things I would like to think about as",
      "we do this is to find out how important comparison shopping is to the consumer. Is the idea that it is enough to have plans segregated by actuarial value, is that enough for comparison-\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090shopping, or should it be more parsed out? I feel that should be informed by some expert research.",
      "i. Dan Meuse: We know that there has been some research done into quality rating, and satisfaction, and seeing how the consumer compares that but we will go further into it.",
      "k. Mike Gerhardt: The purpose of innovation is to drive down the price \u2013 this is not something that happens in a vacuum.",
      "i. Dan Meuse: Right. That is one of the important points: it is important to innovate with the goals in mind. In coordination with partner agencies having the goals of making a more rational delivery system, improving health of Rhode Islanders, achieving near universal coverage.",
      "l. Pam McKnight: I think it is important to hear innovative ideas both from the exchange but also from carriers as they may have different goals. We want to promote both and do not feel it should be an either/or approach to the problem.",
      "m. Secretary Costantino: Let\u2019s say a carrier puts out a plan with payment reforms, intense primary care model \u2013 is that innovation?",
      "i. Dan Meuse: I would argue that it is, that exchange has wide latitude what it thinks is an innovative practice and can selectively work with carriers on innovative issues.",
      "n. Amy Zimmerman: You spoke about the potential for competition and alignment. Without enough alignment you will not have enough market-\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090share for it to be effective.",
      "i. Dan Meuse: Excellent point \u2013 talking about three or four state entities, driving and trying to move towards a goal as a state. The exchange\u2019s market share is one thing; it is more powerful when added to other market-\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090shares as well.",
      "o. Commissioner Koller: Was this estimate example done with reduced cost sharing?",
      "i. John Kingsdale: Yes. p. Secretary Costantino: In terms of the labels, gold, silver, bronze, is it",
      "all based on cost sharing? Does it have anything to do with the type of benefit?",
      "i. John Kingsdale: You could do that, or let carriers say we want HMO instead of PPO but they are based on cost sharing.",
      "ii. Dan Meuse: It is actuarial value, not simply cost sharing. Say a single service, a single specialist visit, with two plans both have copays of $20.00 (for example), you would think it would the same metal label, but as the actuarial value may be different, then the metals could be different for each plan. The federal government will provide a calculator.",
      "q. Director Licht: When you say a calculator do you mean they will provide the actuaries?",
      "i. Dan Meuse: They hare collecting the data and are creating a calculator in which we input data, and it will somehow come out with an actuarial value.",
      "ii. Director Licht: If I am paying $20.00 for the same service, and theoretically it could be with the same doctor, but because of the work of the carrier it could be a different metal?",
      "iii. John Kingsdale: Yes, but it is not a precise science \u2013 if they are close they may be the same.",
      "iv. Director Licht: But to the theory, regardless of percentile tolerance, what is the theory that one is better than the other.",
      "v. John Kingsdale: There isn\u2019t the theory that one is better than another. Remember this is a commercial population., averaged over a group.",
      "r. Secretary Costantino: Thirty-\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090nine potential quality plans could be offered, but ninety thousand is the pool, does that make sense?",
      "i. John Kingsdale: Right and actually that is the purpose of this slide \u2013 to show that with just three carriers already at 39 options. That demonstrates this can get complicated quickly.",
      "s. Director Licht: What does OOP stand for? i. John Kingsdale: Out of Pocket",
      "t. Director Licht: How do you explain to a purchaser what the difference is to a PPO or a HMO briefly? If you are giving them a choice how would they know what they are working towards?",
      "i. John Kingsdale: That is a great point, and by and large there are only about 17 people who understand all of this and most are in this room. Most will click and read, and that is what private insurance is.",
      "ii. Director Licht: Have a click on definition perhaps? iii. Mike Gerhardt: It is almost a distinction without a difference at",
      "this time? iv. John Kingsdale: There has been a fair amount of convergence",
      "here at least. u. Secretary Costantino: You don\u2019t see standardization?",
      "i. John Kingsdale: Yes, clearly some tension if you go from one extreme or the other. If you go all standardization then there will be discord, or if you go all the other way there will be challenges.",
      "v. Director Licht: When you say \u201coffers at least two of the prescribed innovations,\u201d do you mean that BCBS offers two innovations and Tufts offers two, then that is actually four innovations. Thus there are more than even thirty-\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090nine options?",
      "i. John Kingsdale: Yes, potentially, depending on the nature of the innovation.",
      "w. Tim Melia: Will carriers want that innovation in that mix and have folks identify it?",
      "i. John Kingsdale: Believe that they will. x. Commissioner Koller: In this example, nineteen is better than thirty-\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090",
      "nine, it may be helpful to touch on how standard is standard.",
      "i. John Kingsdale: Ask carriers to submit, gold, silver, and bronze. Then provide to a consumer group. There was confusion amongst the consumers at each of these junctures. Thus there was a push to standardize amongst gold, silver and bronze.",
      "ii. Commissioner Koller: Is there one set of cost sharing then or five?",
      "iii. John Kingsdale: In this example, there are five designs across the six variables and each of the carriers has a QHP.",
      "y. Secretary Costantino: What happens if the affordability issue hasn\u2019t changed at all? Will there be an opportunity to have a plan within the constructs of this sample that can get to the affordability level? I am just getting back there to see the standardization vs. innovation.",
      "i. John Kingsdale: A consumer may well say I can only afford $400.00 per month for my family, and only one plan will pop up. The additional elements are that if you are below 400% of FPL, then there are subsidies.",
      "z. Director Licht: Right now, 80% of Rhode Islanders who have health insurance have no say in what their plan looks like. They get a plan from their employer, and the insured has no say. Now you are taking eighty thousand or so people who are uninsured and you are asking them to chose from nineteen or thirty-\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090nine or even twelve or fifteen plans and make a choice when no one in RI knows how or does make this choice. I am waiting for some form of comfort or security that this will work. What can you say to that?",
      "i. John Kingsdale: Your question is really a fundamental one of the exchange. There are a lot of things consumers love to shop for but health insurance is not one of them. That is why this complexity needs to be limited, you might want to have some standardization, and you need there to be logic to help the consumer limit his or her focus. Perhaps as the Secretary had suggested, and give a price point. Or perhaps give a way to search by what is covered etc.",
      "ii. Director Licht: It seems to me that you have to get the consumer and have them decide what metal they would like.",
      "iii. John Kingsdale: Yes, and can organize it different ways. aa. Linda Katz: If you go on the website and pick the Medicare or",
      "supplemental plan, how do I have enough information to make one choice over another? I think we need to build in that consumer assistance.",
      "i. John Kingsdale: Good point, most people get one design from the carrier, the carrier works with the broker, etc. This individual choice context is very different. There has been pressure over time to reduce that pressure.",
      "bb. Amy Zimmerman: Has there been experience where small businesses place more emphasize on the business owners to make affordable choices for their business?",
      "i. John Kingsdale: We have done research with businesses on this question. People do prefer broad choice. When you dig a little deeper there are rating problems with giving everyone broad choice, and employers think that doing that will add competition. There are some practical reasons you may want an employer to say I can subsidize silver or bronze, and then can offer choice across carriers at that level. It is the decision of this exchange to inform employers of how many options they have.",
      "cc. Tim Melia: You are presenting plans to small businesses that still are not affordable, and thus will not drive a lot of businesses to the exchange.",
      "i. John Kingsdale: The main thing driving silver is that you need to have three separate silver plans to meet the cost sharing option, in the individual market. Two standard, one unique, and have to have a richer version of that standard. You could drive it to one, plus the three variances of silver, but giving up options.",
      "ii. Commissioner Koller: This is good as giving up standardization and choice. We need to learn also from the experiences of other places, whether it be Part D or the Connector, we need to learn from these past examples.",
      "IV. Wrap Up: a. Dan Meuse: important to the staff at this point, is for the Board to say",
      "to the staff there are models they would like more information on, or models to take off this spectrum. The goal is to come back in the middle of the summer with essentially a white paper with two or three of these models would be effectuated, make recommendations to the director on which way to go.",
      "b. Secretary Costantino: Is there any algorithm that will say you will have more penetration with one model or another? Is there any science to this that would help inform out decision on this.",
      "i. John Kingsdale: There is no science, but some significant percent will be that customers will be driven as individuals, so really talking about 40% or so. You want the carriers to be actively marketing the exchange, want some options that work for them, you want enough choice that you are not missing the market, and you want it to be simple and usable enough to make this easy to shop. I think we can dive into the specifics and say these options are too far, and go to the extreme.",
      "ii. Deb Faulkner: Whatever we start with in year one is not what we will end up with in year four. We are considering a phased approach and test the heck out of it. As we learn, we evolve our strategy accordingly. The best models we have are the Massachusetts experience and the Utah limited experience, but we need to try and test.",
      "c. Amy Zimmerman: Typically when doing a spectrum and want to find balance, perhaps cut off the two ends. This will help you think about balancing and more information for the center three.",
      "d. Linda Katz: Perhaps can we have another meeting on this, perhaps help us walk through on the connector so we can see what happens with choice, and then talk more about the innovations on the last slide? We will look at the three in the middle and come back is an option, but it feels that we should have more discussion about this with additional information.",
      "i. Secretary Costantino: I agree with Linda. Maybe after you see the whole thing that will be more clear.",
      "e. Commissioner Koller: I am comfortable with Amy\u2019s suggestion of lopping off the edges. Would recommend from personal experience that we need to stand this up, so we may see what is important to incorporate in design, etc.",
      "f. Secretary Costantino: Does this decision have to be made today? i. Dan Meuse: Not have to be, but then the next Board meeting would need to be the follow up discussion.",
      "g. Commissioner Koller: The slide that was put up with the nineteen options seems to say to me do not over do innovation \u2013 keep it simple?",
      "h. Linda Katz: If we ask you to go with the middle three and do a white paper on those three are we asking you to do unnecessary work when if we look at it during another session we can narrow it further.",
      "i. Dan Meuse: We can provide in-\u00ad\u00e2\u0080\u0090depth reports on all five of these and because you are only choosing one would be a lot of work, but as a staff we do not want to direct a decision without providing you the most important background data.",
      "ii. Linda Katz: Okay, but then I feel that discussion needs to be had about the how the three middle models have the effect on choice, on simplicity and what are important from that big laundry list of criteria. Are there year one items that the Board would want to include?",
      "i. Mike Gerhardt: I would lop off the ends to limit the staff work and focus our efforts. In a way issuer defined innovation and exchange defined innovation can be merged, to what is the best innovation rather than what is the arbitrary distinction of who proposed what.",

      "Davies video to be used as a recruitment/marketing tool for perspective students/parents, business partners, and government leaders. We had to get three bids from video production companies through the State of RI Purchasing system. DonnaMac Voice was the one selected based on their bid. We have developed good talking points for the video about how Davies is the place to be for technical preparation and college, the best of both worlds. A videographer and a sound person did the video shoot. They went around to every technical area, took some shots with the students, and conducted interviews with teachers, alumni, students and partners. The target date to complete this is June 30th in order to meet the closing of the FY12 budget. We will have the opportunity to edit the video from now until June 30th. Once finalized, it will be uploaded onto the Davies website, on U-Tube, and some hard copies will be made. We are contracted for a 3-4 minute long video. The Guidance Counselors will use it when they go out to the middle schools to do outreach and awareness.",
      "DonnaMac is a quality organization. In fact, the sound and video people did",
      "work for 60 Minutes. So hopefully that will translate into our video. Mr. Blumenthal thanked Mr. Gemma for stepping up to be in the video. In fact, they were very impressed with Mr. Gemma.",
      "4) 2012 Senior Placement Survey Report \u2014 Bernie Blumenthal (See Supplemental Material: \u201cDavies Graduates: 2012 Placement Data (as of 6/1/12)",
      "This is a survey that the School-to-Career Office conducts every year with the seniors and Mr. Blumenthal reports it out to the Board. The report he gives in June is a preliminary report prior to the final exams. During the months of August or September, the office calls these seniors to re-survey them to see if their plans had changed since the time of the first survey. He then reports out to the Board a final report in October. They ask them what their plans are upon graduation, college and are they accepted and if so, what major are they interested in pursuing. Is their major related to their technical areas? Are they interested in full-time work and if so, where and is it in their related field. Are they interested in going into the military? If they hadn\u2019t made any plans, they are asked if they anticipate pursuing a career in their related field sometime down the road.",
      "3",
      "Referring to the second page of the handout, 48% of the students are going on to post-secondary education. This is down from last year at 60%. Mr. Blumenthal thinks this is because if they decided to apply late and with space being so tight, they didn\u2019t get in. Mrs. Smith added that at CCRI, they would get in, but all the developmental courses that students need coming from high school are already filled. Of the 48% going onto college, 47% of the majors are related to their training. It\u2019s a good amount; it\u2019s higher than what has been seen in the last couple of years. Mr. Blumenthal assumes more will get to college so this number will go up. The Employment category is one that has been revised. In the past, when Mr. Blumenthal said \u201cemployment\u201d it what just employment that was related to their technical field. It didn\u2019t take into account those students who are working part-time or full-time in a non-related field so it made our numbers look at little bit worse. He added another column, \u201cRelated Employment\u201d so we can now see those who are at least continuing on in their field. 10% will be working in their field which has been the norm. The \u201cMilitary\u201d is at only 3% which is very surprising based on the way students were talking. He expected it to be a very high number. The \u201cUndecided\u201d always concerns him. 25% of the students didn\u2019t express any kind of interest, work, college, not quite sure. He didn\u2019t see any sense of energy from this group. Those students that didn\u2019t seem focused where from Culinary, Electrical, Building and Construction Trades, and Automotive. With the college choices, 36% are going to a four-year and 63% are going to a two-year. Those going to a two-year are for financial reasons or they are not sure so they want to stay close to get the credits and then decide. Only 1% are going on to a technical school, UTI. Could it be because of the expense because these technical schools are very expensive especially UTI? Mr. Chartier asked if Mr. Blumenthal heard if it was because of financial reasons why some of the 24% were undecided. He heard nothing from them. Mr. Halkyard added that the \u201cundecided\u201d numbers have always been a concern. Is it part of our Guidance program that Guidance Counselors instill in these students that very soon they will be graduating and out there with nothing to do? They really need to start thinking about getting a job, doing something. Is this part of what the Guidance Counselors do? Mrs. Gailliard-Garrick answered, \u201cThey should as part of the student\u2019s ILP, Individual Learning Plan.\u201d That ILP kind of maps out what they are going to do through high school and transitioning them from high school to the world of work or post-secondary education. This is something that she needs to look at with the counselors to make sure they are working with these kids that are undecided, and they should have an idea who those students are who are not motivated to do anything. The end of the sophomore year is a very challenging time for students because it is at that time some realize they do not like the shop they are in. What do",
      "4",
      "we do at that point? Do we have flexibility to move them? They are on their way to certifications. Space is at a premium with the new students coming in. So it is a challenge; what do we do with that group? School-to-Career moved up Career Awareness up to the sophomore year before they meet with them as juniors for Employability Skills. They try to generate this notion that their technical field and career awareness have great possibilities. Between 50-75% of students want to carry on in their field depending what technical area they are in. We need to attack those programs with less interest and provide them with more career awareness. Part of his goals for the new School Improvement Plan is to create College Awareness Center here and he would take the lead in coordinating it. Dr. Segovis added that he could get some Board help and alumni help in doing that. Mr. Halkyard read an article about military recruitment and they are finding these days that more and more of the kids are not qualified, even to volunteer, either because of academics or physical fitness. That may be why the \u201cMilitary\u201d percentage is low.",
      "5) 2012 Technical Certifications Report \u2014 Gerry Manning",
      "(See Supplemental Material: \u201cWilliam M. Davies, Jr. Career and Technical Industry Certifications\u201d and \u201cCertifications 2012\u201d \u201cCertifications 2012\u201d is a one-year view. Automotive was very strong at 100% across the board. Biomanufacturing doesn\u2019t have certifications at this time. They are looking into adding some certifications next year. What they do have at this time is two articulation courses. In the past, they had 100% passing them, but we had a transition of two new teachers this year who are trying to align the articulation more into the junior/senior year than in the sophomore/junior year because it will hold more value so close to college. Building and Construction Trades, what is missing on the chart is all 7 students have their OSHA 10 certifications. They have no conclusive information on NCCER Level 1 and Core Curricula. They are all pending final testing. Business Technology, this program is being phased out and moving toward Electronic Health Records, but the seniors in this BT completed 100% of their certifications. Cosmetology, 100% passed their written and practical for their state license. Electrical, there was a huge improvement with 100% certifications in NCCER Level 1 and Core Curricula. Electronics, students took a test for ESA 2 on May 30th and those results have not come in yet but you can see from ESA 1, 3, and 4 and the IPC, students did fairly well with those certifications. Print Ed, the numbers are down a little bit and don\u2019t know why. There is nothing definitive to explain why. Mrs. Gailliard-Garrick said it was because when the CIS program was closed, 8 of those seniors went into Graphic Arts. Those kids should have been separated out in this report because they were not prepared for that test. If you look at the kids who were actually in Graphic Arts from 10th grade up, you will see 100% passing and those 8 who were not trained in Graphic Arts, we just did components of the program with them. They shouldn\u2019t have been added into the report. That is what happened. Health Careers, the Adult CPR/AED and First Aid are just in the process of finishing now. Those numbers should be in by the end of the year, but typically, they finish at 100% certified. We had one teacher out since January so they are a little bit behind in getting those kids certified but they expect to have it done",
      "5",
      "by the end of the year. Hospitality, 100% ServeSafe and 100% NOCTI in Baking and Culinary. OSHA will be added next year since one of the Culinary teachers is certified to teach it. This is our second year since we transitioned from ProStart to NOCTI. This year\u2019s results are a great accomplishment. Machine Technology, 100% certification with NIMS. Mrs. Gailliard-Garrick mentioned that we have some very strong shops and over the course of \u201cx\u201d amount of years, we are going to be looking at those shops that are the strongest and hopefully keeping them up and running and get those students who will be motivated to go onto college or the world of work. She wants to commend Culinary Arts that has come a long way. Machine Technology is building rapidly. There has been a major, major shift in that shop. Our Graphic Arts department is exploding along with Electronics. We have our Health Careers program where we added another career path called Electronic Health Records that will kick off in September with our first 10th graders who went through an exploratory program at NEIT this year. She took a tour at NEIT and talked about developing a partnership with them in the healthcare area, IT for the Graphic Arts and interesting enough for Machine Technology. It is part of the Perkins Reauthorization. You have to have these articulation agreements with these business partnerships. We are on the right track in building the programs that RIDE wants to see. Great job to these technical teachers. The other handout is a five-year breakout of the data. All in all our programs have stepped up. It was an important year for them with the understanding of what the funding situation is. There is change going on with Perkins along with new CTE regulations. Everybody understands that not only are we under the microscope but that their programs are in jeopardy if they don\u2019t have high quality, state-of-the-art, keeping up with industry and having the certifications to back it up. Biomanufacturing is looking into adding certifications to their program for next year. Machine Technology, which has had only one certification, is looking at having 4 new certifications for next year. They had a showcase last week and it was phenomenal. They had over 100 people attend. All our programs need to showcase what they do. In addition to this new video, the programs need to do some PR of their own and that is what the Machine teacher did. Mr. Gemma asked if these certifications translate into post-graduate jobs. Yes, these are all certifications that are recognized by industry. This is what the hold-up has been in Biomanufacturing. They added certifications in their budget for next year, but they need to meet with their advisory board to find out which of those certifications they found on the BINOME (sp?) website is recognized by industry so they can go and pursue them for the students. They are also adding another component to this program. The two teachers are looking into nanotechnology. They are getting some training in that and then they will be adding another module into their curriculum. Mr. Fangiullo wanted the Board to know that Mr. Manning and Mr. Blumenthal did a great job in guiding us through this year\u2019s Perkins application process. The application didn\u2019t come in until a very short time",

      "Old Kent Road Property Issue Presentation",
      "Kathy and John Nottell represent the New Kent Group, LLC, which consists of the three couples in the",
      "neighborhood who purchased the 23 acre property. Their group\u2019s mission is to protect the land so",
      "there is no development on it and they came to the PRA to ask us to acquire the entire parcel as",
      "protected open space. Ms. Nottell urged PRA members to return to see the property again after",
      "considerable clean-up and clearing of trees and vegetation. Mr. Nottell provided information on the",
      "buildings on the site. Mr. Lockett pointed out that it would take a lot of money to purchase the",
      "property and make the buildings usable. Mr. Nero said that the Rhode Island Department of",
      "Environmental Management (RIDEM) had suggested they might be able to provide a grant of 50% of",
      "the purchase price. This grant would be competitive but RIDEM has indicated that the project would",
      "be looked on favorably. There are other grant possibilities available as well, including trail grants and",
      "recreational development grants.",
      "Mr. Nero said it would make a good headquarters for the PRA, saving us the cost of rent. Downsides",
      "include (1) private property with homes on it between the land we might acquire and much of the",
      "riverfront and (2) an outdoor, in-ground swimming pool with a poolhouse; the pool is covered and has",
      "a fence around it. On a motion by Mr. Langlais, seconded by Mr. Goodinson, the board voted to",
      "explore potential financing options. The Nottells again urged PRA members to visit the property.",
      "Their group plans to get an appraisal of the property within a month and hopes to have an asking price",
      "by the PRA\u2019s September meeting. They have incurred expenses including property taxes, legal and",
      "accounting fees, and clean-up costs.",
      "The Nottells left the meeting and discussion continued. Mr. Nero pointed out that the pool would be a",
      "problem; it would cost thousands of dollars to fill it in. This would be a years-long commitment. Ms.",
      "Holahan suggested a special meeting just to discuss this property; it was scheduled for Sunday, August",
      "19 at 9 a.m., starting with a tour of the property.",
      "Treasurer\u2019s Report Ms. Holahan distributed copies of an updated financial report showing restricted and unrestricted",
      "funds. The Finance Committee still needs to meet to discuss the accountant\u2019s proposal for the audit.",
      "There is potential for the PRA to have a different IRS classification that would allow us to apply to",
      "more foundations for funding. The application fee would be $400 and our accountant\u2019s charges to",
      "prepare the necessary forms would be $400.",
      "The Finance Committee will meet on Monday, August 13 at 5:30 at the PRA office regarding the audit.",
      "Special Meeting",
      "Mr. Nero said that we have some issues that need to be discussed in closed session with our attorney.",

      "work yet.",
      "Phenix Harris and Arkwright Riverwalks: At Phenix-Harris, work is needed, particularly on",
      "the trees at both entrances. The guard rail on the Coventry end needs to be replaced or repaired. At",

      "language within this section and submit it to Mr. Griffith for further consideration.",
      "Mr. Parsons asked why the project priority lists included in the document were for 2009 and 2010 and not 2011. In",

      "Mr. Trevor asked if the language for 38 Studios listed on page 16 should be revised. Mr. Parsons concurred noting",

      "Ms. Mahoney asked if it was essential that the document be approved at this meeting of the Council or if it could be",

      "the vote until the report had been updated.",
      "Ms. Boyle asked if the $15M the state received in disaster relief funding was reflected in the report. Mr. Griffith",
      "indicated that it wasn\u2019t and Mr. Flynn stated that the specific EDA disaster projects that were funded could easily be",
      "added.",
      "As there was no further discussion, the Council decided to table this agenda item until the July meeting. In closing,",

      "provides an overview of the structure of the Statewide Planning Program and the context in which it works. Section",
      "2 he explained reports on the progress that was made in implementing the work tasks for the current year.",
      "At this point Mr. Rhodes paused to ask if there were any questions or concerns regarding Section 1 and 2. There",
      "being none, Mr. Rhodes discussed section 4, which identifies the staff that will be dedicated to implementing the",

      "and the estimated cost per task. Mr. Rhodes then highlighted the following:",

      "not intended for a new grant round in the coming year but are rather included to allow for payment of",

      "With the formal presentation complete, Mr. Licht first asked how the funds listed in the Appendix relate to those",
      "shown in Table 4-1. Mr. Rhodes responded that the funds are unrelated. Those shown in Table 4-1 he explained are",
      "funds specifically dedicated to the Statewide Planning Program whereas those in and Appendix A-3 are dedicated to",
      "RIDOT and RIPTA respectively.",

      "planning purposes.",
      "As there was no further questions, Mr. Rhodes asked the Council to approve the proposed work program and to",
