Located at 14 Westwood Drive, Cumberland, RI 02864.", "Ms. Brenda Farrell was brought into the Zoom Webinar, was sworn, and testified in favor of this request for Dimensional Variance. Ms. Farrell stated that they want to put an addition on that is going to enlarge the already-existing three bedrooms that they have, and they want to add a master bathroom because there is only one bathroom to this home. She stated that the addition will go forward because they cannot really go backward because of the septic system, the rain garden, and the stairwell that leads out from the basement, which is the only other egress from the basement. Ms. Farrell stated that they are asking for the variance for the front to go basically four feet within the 25 feet on one corner, and on the other corner it was only going to go two or three feet. She further stated that they had spoken with her neighbor behind them, who is Peggy and Jim Normandin; and they did not have any arguments or questions about the addition, and they all thought it would be good for the whole street and the neighborhood property values to update the home.", "When Ms. Farrell concluded her testimony,Mr. McCoy asked Mr. Craveiro to read into the record the Planning Board recommendation, which he did.", "After brief hearing, Mr. Chaput made a motion to grant a four-foot front yard variance to the applicant to allow them to erect the addition to their home as they request in their application.", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "11", "12", "13", "14", "15", "16", "17", "18", "19", "20", "21", "22", "23", "24", "25", "4", "Mr. Chaput stated that the restriction of the front yard variance, the reason they need a deviation from that is because of the unique nature of the property. He stated that, because of the DEM issues, they need to keep their septic system and the rain garden in the places where they are, and they need egress from their basement. He stated that they have made a strong case as to why that addition needs to be placed where it is.", "As findings, Mr. Chaput stated the following:The hardship that they have is not a result of", "any prior action and does not result from the desire to achieve financial gain. He stated they just want to enlarge their home and make it more livable.", "The granting will not alter the general characteristic of the surrounding area. Mr. Chaput stated that the Planning Board clearly says that, even though the house will be larger than its neighbors, it will fit in very well with the plan; and the setback deviation they are looking for is really fairly small.", "The relief to be granted is the least relief necessary, as they have shown, because of the objects that are in the back of the property.", "If the application were denied, the hardship would be more than a mere inconvenience. It would not allow them to build the addition that they so clearly want to do.", "Mr. McGrath then seconded the motion and asked if it could be added that they have to comply with the DEM regulations on the side lot. Mr. McCoy stated that could be added as a condition. Mr. Chaput stated that it could be added, but DEM would assist on that anyway, so the enforcement will probably be by DEM. Mr. McCoy stated he thought that was right, but he did not see a problem in adding it as a condition; and he stated they certainly cannot build without DEM. Mr. McCoy then took a vote on the motion. Mr. Chaput, Mr. LeBlanc, Mr. McGrath,Mr. Craveiro and Mr. McCoy all voted in favor of the motion.

JAK Realty, LLC, of 2295 Diamond Hill Road, Cumberland, RI 02864, has petitioned this board for a Dimensional Variance for freestanding sign, Maximum height, and Minimum setback. Article 13. Described as Assessor's Plat 024, Lot(s) 0016 & 0130, and Designated Zone C-1. Located at 2295 & 2311 Diamond Hill Road, Cumberland, RI 02864.", "Attorney Scott Partington was present to represent JAK Realty on this request. In support of the application, Mr. Partington presented as a witness Mrs. Pauline Khabbaz, who came forward, was sworn, and testified in favor of this request. Through questioning by Mr. Partington, Ms. Khabbaz stated that her office address is 2295 Diamond Hill Road and that she and her husband are the owners of JAK Realty. She also stated that she and her husband own the property located 2295 Diamond Hill Road. Mr. Partington asked Ms. Khabbaz to explain what forced them to relocate the sign and what prompted or compelled its relocation. Mrs. Khabbaz stated that, a couple of years ago, the Rhode Island DOT approached them and told them that they had to move the sign located on their property. She stated that, despite the fact that they had been doing business there for 15 years and that property has been there for decades, they had to move the sign; and they did not want to move the sign. She stated that the sign is very important to their property; but they forced them to move the sign, and DOT assured them that they could relocate the sign because it was on their property.", "Mrs. Khabbaz also stated that this was not a self-imposed hardship. She stated that by removing that sign it is difficult for people to find their business and find other businesses that are in the building. She stated that this hardship was placed upon them by the Rhode Island DOT.", "Mr. Partington further asked Mrs. Khabbaz if they were simply asking to have the same height as the sign that was located directly across from them, and she stated that was correct. Mr. Partington further asked if that was basically what they were asking for now, a 12-foot sign, and Mrs. Khabbaz answered that was correct.", "Mr. Partington elicited further testimony from Mrs. Khabbaz, and further discussion ensued. No one else came forward to testify either in favor or against this request.", "After hearing, Mr. Chaput made a motion to", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "11", "12", "13", "14", "15", "16", "17", "18", "19", "20", "21", "22", "23", "24", "25", "6", "grant variances from two provisions of Article 13, the Sign Ordinance, as follows: The first to allow a four-foot variance to the maximum height to allow a 12-foot sign to be constructed; and the second for a variance of four feet for the minimum setback so as to allow the applicants to place the sign as they requested in their application.", "Mr. Chaput stated, in terms of the standards, as to Exhibit B in the application, Mr. Partington has made an eloquent description of all these standards and how they fit in this particular instance, andMr. Chaput referred to Exhibit B to show that he makes his points with each of those standards. Mr. Chaput stated the sign is very sensible, and the size of it is consistent with the size of signs elsewhere in the area; and you need a large sign as people try to wen their way through the new roundabouts, so they need to be something that is highly visible to be able to survive in that traffic environment.", "Mr. Chaput further stated it is really the least relief necessary and is a good resolution, after the discussion they had only a month ago. He stated, in referring to Exhibit B in terms of the standards, he recommended that the Board grant those variances. Mr. Chaput stated there are two provisions that are included in the Planning Board's memo. He stated that the first one is the Building Permit to be issued after the administrative officer of the Planning Board approves the landscape plan. Mr. Chaput stated he believed that language as written allows the administrative officer to give that approval, so he did not think the Board needed to modify that. He stated the other condition is that the installation and design conform with Article 13-6 which requires curb, bollards or other protective features to protect the freestanding signs from circulation and parking areas. Mr. Chaput stated that was his motion. Mr. McCoy stated that the motion by Mr. Chaput is to grant the requested two variances with the two conditions as adopted by the Planning Board's memorandum, and he then asked for a second to the motion. Mr. McGrath then seconded the motion, and Mr. McCoy then took a vote on the motion. Mr. Chaput, Mr. LeBlanc, Mr. McGrath, Mr. Craveiro and Mr. McCoy all voted in favor of the motion.

Conservation-110420 packet.pdf Jay Kolyer presenting. The initial design extended 65 feet past MLW but was reduced to 50 feet, which no longer required a variance. CRMC asked for review of bottom growth, and a check by a biologist indicated that the water moves rapidly enough that there is no growth. The shore section was extended from 15 feet to 20 feet to avoid the fringe wetland. The plan is to launch kayaks and dinghies and the end of the pier ramps down to the floating pier. W Dowdell stated that Tim Motte (CRMC) had asked for the changes that J Kolyer described earlier. In response to A Cohen, W Dowdell stated that the posts were standard coastal requirement (CCA 2.0-2.5). In response to J Bergenstock, W Dowdell stated that the stops were designed to keep the floating pier off the bottom and out of the ice and J Kolyer stated that the total length of the fixed pier and entrance ramp was 85 feet and that it was similar to other nearby docks. In response to B Ray, J Kolyer stated that he was a resident of Maryland and North Kingstown, RI, and will move his tax residence to NK in one to two years. T Kolyer stated that the channel is wider in his location than nearby. Detailed discussion took place of whether the dock met the maximum distance specified in the CRMC Red Book, which limits the dock to 25-percent of the shore-to-shore width measured at MLW. W Dowdell stated that the project would comply with the regulation but that it was not brought up during discussion with CRMC. Detailed discussion took place about the possible interference with boat traffic due to the dock termination point and the topography of the channel. B Ray asked if the dock end could be rotated to alleviate the concern over channel access, to which B Lamond responded that this would require a setback from the abutting properties. A Sonder stated that there was approximately two feet of depth 15 feet off the end of the dock and that an option is to keep boats off the end of the dock.

Then meetingwas held outside at Manville Park at 175 High Street, Mainville, RI 02838. A motion wasmade by member Andy Bruscini and was seconded by member Frank Kelly to accepttheminutes from the October 14th meeting. The minutes were accepted. Director\u2019s Report: John Sharkeyspoke to Alan Moreau and he stated that the fences and bleachers are on holdfor this year. The Manville Soccer fieldas far as he knows is still on. The newinfield at Sullivan was complete a weekago. The town needs to start the leaf pickup and taking down the battingcages. Commissioner\u2019s Report: Saylesville- Chris Behlke \u2013Lonsdale- Sean Gaughan \u2013 Status quo. The leaves need to be cleaned up, but prettymuch everything isthe same as last month. The fence in the new soccer field was put up and they stained it. The bridgeleading to Gateway Park and ChaseFarm is still the same and would just take one piece of wood to fix it. The park in general looks good. Albion- John Sharkey \u2013 Albion Park looksreally good. The bathrooms areclosed. The irrigation system hasbeenblown out. There are weeds in theinfield. The batting cage needs to betaken down. We need a parksign with therules listed. The facial board needs tobe replaced still. Manville- Frank Morin \u2013 This was Frank\u2019sfirst meeting as commission member. Thereis litter on the groundalways near the basketball court. No one uses the trashcan. The trashcan in the front iscompletelyoverflowing. The grass was cut and looksgood. There are leaves, but they are notthat bad. Thebasketball court wasresurfaced and they sealed all of the cracks over the summer. It looks really nice. There is some vandalism/spray painting on thepavilion, but it was all repainted and fixed. We need camerasat Manville Park first. The ballfield is in really nice shape. The Manville Farm league had a long list of thingsto do to theballfield, and the town completed all of them. They redid the pitcher\u2019s mound and put sand/gravelin the dugouts. The town put new boards on thebleachers. When it rains the ballfieldfloods at home plate. The concessionstand has water damage. The paint is coming off and the concrete blocks aredisintegrating. When it rains, it goesright in through the door. Frank wouldlike to propose to put a new window. Whodoeshe talk to about getting a new window? John suggested that he gets quotes and presents them at thenextmeeting. The park is in pretty goodshape. The growth area near theconcession stand looks like it wascut down. We tend to have problems with the kids in the woods area over by thesoccer field. It would benice toincorporate the woods area in the project of redoing the soccer field. We definitely need an irrigationsystem withthe new field. Maybe we could addirrigation to the ballfield too when they are redoing the soccerfield? Everything in the playground looks prettygood. All new woodchips were put in overthe summer. Fairlawn- Andy Bruscini \u2013 There is a bunch ofleaves in the parking lot and along the third base side. Thereare three missing lights on thebuilding. There is a tree down by thepavilion. The cathouse is downandsomeone was putting food in it. Limerock- Frank Kelly \u2013 The Park looks thesame as the previous month. There isstill a picnic table in themiddle of the front field standing up straight withan L-screen up against it. This couldfall on someone. Thebathrooms arelocked and the porta john is gone. Theback fence still has the same issues. One of the tennisnets is all ripped. There is no sign at the entrance to the park with the rules on it. The batting cage is still upin the backfield. We need new playground equipmentat Lime Acres. No one uses the existingplayground. Quinville- William Goho \u2013 The Park looks goodand is well maintained. There are leavesup against thefencing. Sean askedhow we do not have a field house at the High School. Sean reported that we are seriouslylackinggym space for sports teams and parks and recreation programs. John said that we need to getproactive for afield house at the High School. We needto see if there is some sort of plan and who isspearheading this. Every commission member should talk to theircouncilman to see what they know. Maybe wecould all walk through Camp Meehan on a Saturday or a Sunday together.

The following Commission members were in attendance: Chairman Smith, Ken Mason, Robert Strom, Kathleen Lanphear, Frederick Vincent, Joseph Morales and Robert Coupe. The following Planning Department members were in attendance: Jason M. Pezzullo, Planning Director, Douglas McLean, Principal Planner, Joshua Berry, Senior Planner, Joanne Resnick, Clerk. Also attending: Steve Marsella, Assistant City Solicitor. SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT \u201cWaldron Ave Minor - Replat of Record Lots 568, 569, and 570\u201d Preliminary Plan - Minor Subdivision without street extension One additional single-family house lot 97 Waldron Avenue - AP 9 \u2013 1155, 1156, 1157 Mr. Pezzullo explained the proposal is to subdivide/merge 3 existing lots of record (totaling 11,000 ft2) into 2 new lots. If approved, Parcel B will host an existing single-family house on 6,000 ft2 of land, and Parcel A will be a buildable lot on 5,000 ft2 of land. The application requires 2 dimensional variances for Parcel A for proposed substandard lot size (proposed 5,000 ft2 where 6,000 ft2 is required) and proposed irregular side lot line (side lot line does not extend straight from the front of lot to the rear of lot). This application will require subsequent approval for dimensional relief from the Zoning Board of Review. Attorney Robert Murray reiterated that the proposal is pretty straight forward. Parcel A will be 5,000 sq. ft. due to the existing \u201cjog\u201d. Sixty feet of frontage is proposed. Mr. Vincent expressed concern with the slope of the proposed driveways. Mr. Murray explained that the existing retaining wall will remain and a new driveway for the proposed new home will be created. Mr. Mark Reo, property owner, stated that the driveways will be side by side and will be regraded to gradually slope down. He stated that there will be \u201ca parcel between the driveways\u201d. Attorney Murray stated that it is the developer\u2019s intention to work with the Public Works Department for guidance on \u201chow this should be handled. Mr. Mason, Public Works Director, stated that two separate curb cuts will be required. No public comment was offered on this matter. Upon motion made by Mr. Vincent and seconded by Mr. Strom, the Plan Commission unanimously voted (7/0) to adopt the Findings of Fact denoted below and approve this Minor Subdivision, subject to the following conditions as follows:", "Findings of Fact RIGL \u00a7 45-23-60. Procedure \u2013 Required findings. (a)(1) states, \u201cThe proposed development is consistent with the comprehensive community plan and/or has satisfactorily addressed the issues where there may be inconsistencies.\u201d", "1. The Cranston Comprehensive Plan\u2019s Future Land Use Map designates the subject parcels as \u201cSingle/Two Family Residential Less Than 10.89 units per acre\u201d. The proposed density of the project is 7.92 units/per acres (including the pre-existing single-family dwelling) so the project is in conformance with the Future Land Use Map despite the need for a lot size variance. Additionally, the Land Use Plan Element recognizes that many existing lots in the eastern portion of the city are undersized, and the Comprehensive Plan supports the development of these lots, stating: \u201c\u2026the City grants variances routinely when properties are 5,000 square feet limiting the purpose and effectiveness of the existing minimum size requirements. The City needs to address this issue and consider changing regulations to reflect the higher density in these areas, which are essentially built out and have an older housing stock.\u201d The Comprehensive Plan supports the development of undersized lots and provides clear policy direction relevant to this proposal. Furthermore, the proposal is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan Housing Element in that development of infill lots is encouraged in Eastern Cranston.", "2. Significant cultural, historic or natural features that contribute to the attractiveness of the community have not been identified on site.", "RIGL \u00a7 45-23-60. Procedure \u2013 Required findings. (a)(2) states, \u201cThe proposed development is in compliance with the standards and provisions of the municipality's zoning ordinance.\u201d", "3. The proposed lots will require zoning relief for substandard lot size and an irregular side lot line. Should approval be granted through a separate decision by the Zoning Board of Review, the project will be in compliance with the City\u2019s zoning ordinance.", "4. The proposal will not alter the general character of the surrounding area or impair the intent or purpose of the Cranston Zoning Code.", "RIGL \u00a7 45-23-60. Procedure \u2013 Required findings. (a)(3) states, \u201cThere will be no significant negative environmental impacts from the proposed development as shown on the final plan, with all required conditions for approval.\u201d", "5. Clearing of vegetation (trees and bushes) may be needed in order to accommodate development on the proposed new buildable lot. However, the vegetation does not provide environmental habitat, and is located within a dense urban neighborhood. Additionally, the project will be subject to all local, state and federal standards regarding environmental impacts. Thus no negative environmental impacts are anticipated.", "6. The Rhode Island November 2018 Natural Heritage map shows that there are no known rare species located on the site.", "RIGL \u00a7 45-23-60. Procedure \u2013 Required findings. (a)(4) states, \u201cThe subdivision, as proposed, will not result in the creation of individual lots with any physical constraints to development that building on those lots according to pertinent regulations and building standards would be impracticable.

It was put in place at the State level to accommodate students and families who, for health reasons, chose to have their children learn remotely. It is also for children who are ill and/or must stay home to quarantine. Healthy in person learners must learn in person, a wellness visit or vacation does not qualify them for distance learning. Dr. Duva noted that accommodating distance learners is challenging and he does not want to further burden overburdened educators unnecessarily. Students are the priority but without teachers there is no learning. The second revision is that if children are out for one day, there is no expectation that students will have to make up the work that day or that teachers will have to provide the material that day.", "In consideration of the public comments, Ms. Schott made some suggestions. A discussion ensued about whether children who are absent for a reason other than COVID-19 are to be accommodated. Restricted Travel Policy During COVID-19 The travel policy specifically references the State of Rhode Island\u2019s policy for travel to a state with a positivity rate of COVID-19 greater than 5%. The recommendation is to quarantine for 14 days. The Jamestown School Department will not accept a negative test result in isolation, everyone MUST quarantine for 14 days. Students who quarantine after returning from a \"hotspot\" may distance learn. Ms. Lapierre noted that the playbook does not require quarantine, but that it is preferred. The District's policy will therefore note that it is taking the state\u2019s recommendation and mandating quarantine. Proposal for Solar Panel Project for Jamestown School Department Mr. Roberts briefed everyone on the bond which passed in 2018 for a solar panel project which would generate sufficient power to offset the Town's costs. When preliminary construction began, they learned that the roofs of the schools are not built to withstand the weight of the panels needed to satisfy the original proposal. There will be additional analysis on what can be done to allow for the project to advance in some way. They will then need to decide how best to proceed. Reopening Schools Update Dr. Duva shared that the COVID Cares Grant received approval for $118,000.00. The expenditures outlined in Ms. Littlefield's presentation on October 22, 2020 and will funded as discussed. The Rhode Island School Building Authority granted the Jamestown School Department $10,000.00 to be spent on Capitol Improvements. They are currently considering how to use the funds but they will likely go towards air quality and ventilation. Ms. Schott noted the importance of trying to create the \"pause\" that Ms. Tuttle requested at the beginning of the meeting. Dr. Duva assured the Committee that he will continue to collect information and do his best to find a time to make the forum happen. Adjournment The School Committee will hold a Meeting November 12, 2020. Mr. Roberts motioned to adjourn the meeting at 6:56 p.m., Ms. Reilly seconded; all were in favor; so moved. /acc ___________________________________ _____________________ Chair, Jamestown School Committee Date"], "latestMinutesLink": "https://opengov.sos.ri.gov/Common/DownloadMeetingFiles?FilePath=/Minutes/4678/2020/380568.pdf"}, {"id": 1000037, "body": "Newport, City of", "meeting_dt": 1604588400.0, "address": "Police Department Assembly Room, 120 Broadway, Newport, RI, 02840", "filing_dt": 1604087520.0, "is_emergency": true, "is_annual_calendar": true, "is_public_notice": true, "is_cancelled": false, "cancelled_dt": null, "cancelled_reason": null, "contactPerson": "Laura Swistak", "contactEmail": "lswistak@cityofnewport.com", "contactPhone": "401-845-5349", "latestAgenda": ["CITY OF NEWPORT", "NOTICE OF VICIOUS DOG HEARING", "November 5, 2020", "10:00 A.M.", "Newport Police Department", "120 BROADWAY", "NEWPORT, RI", "1.

Conservation-110420 packet.pdf Jay Kolyer presenting. The initial design extended 65 feet past MLW but was reduced to 50 feet, which no longer required a variance. CRMC asked for review of bottom growth, and a check by a biologist indicated that the water moves rapidly enough that there is no growth. The shore section was extended from 15 feet to 20 feet to avoid the fringe wetland. The plan is to launch kayaks and dinghies and the end of the pier ramps down to the floating pier. W Dowdell stated that Tim Motte (CRMC) had asked for the changes that J Kolyer described earlier. In response to A Cohen, W Dowdell stated that the posts were standard coastal requirement (CCA 2.0-2.5). In response to J Bergenstock, W Dowdell stated that the stops were designed to keep the floating pier off the bottom and out of the ice and J Kolyer stated that the total length of the fixed pier and entrance ramp was 85 feet and that it was similar to other nearby docks. In response to B Ray, J Kolyer stated that he was a resident of Maryland and North Kingstown, RI, and will move his tax residence to NK in one to two years. T Kolyer stated that the channel is wider in his location than nearby. Detailed discussion took place of whether the dock met the maximum distance specified in the CRMC Red Book, which limits the dock to 25-percent of the shore-to-shore width measured at MLW. W Dowdell stated that the project would comply with the regulation but that it was not brought up during discussion with CRMC. Detailed discussion took place about the possible interference with boat traffic due to the dock termination point and the topography of the channel. B Ray asked if the dock end could be rotated to alleviate the concern over channel access, to which B Lamond responded that this would require a setback from the abutting properties. A Sonder stated that there was approximately two feet of depth 15 feet off the end of the dock and that an option is to keep boats off the end of the dock.

He gave an update of the property to the Planning Commission. In 2010 approval was given to build a house at 85 Frigate St., 1 lot originally. The house permitted at that time was 936 sq ft footprint. Since then the owner has acquired the adjacent lot. He reviewed the water tables and test holes with the planning commission. He would like to build a garage and covered porch. He will be complying with the ordinance. The town Engineer has provided a report for the planning commission. Architect Lisa Carlisle registered in the state of RI for over 30 years and mainly is focused on residential architecture. Commissioner Swistak made a motion seconded by Commissioner Enright to accept Ms. Carlisle as an expert witness. So unanimously voted.", "Planning Commission Minutes November 4, 2020 Page 4 Ms. Carlisle shared a quick synopsis of the existing house and garage. The garage cannot fit a car in it so they are adding a 2 car garage and front porch. She showed the planning commission pictures via zoom which were also included in their packet. A motion was made by Commissioner Swistak and seconded by Commissioner Smith to accept Mr. Neal Hingorany, PSL as an expert witness. So unanimously voted. He made a presentation to the Planning Commission on the current conditions and proposed addition. He showed where the test holes are and the amount of fill. The proposed addition and existing dwelling will still be under the amount allowed. The combined net will remain at 10.8 percent impervious coverage which is what was approved in 2010. They are proposing an infiltrator per town requirements. 841 additional sq ft. They will remove existing driveway in favor of a pervious driveway. Commissioner Cochran asked if the existing driveway is gravel. Neal Hingorany stated that it is compacted gravel and considered impervious. Commissioner Cochran asked what is the shaded area to the west. It is the existing drywell from 2010. Mr. Hingorany said this will not affect drainage. He showed where the gutters and downspouts will drain to. Commissioner Pfeiffer asked if the water is going to be pumped up to the infiltration system. It gets there through gravity.", "Commissioner Enright asked about the interior of the house because of the loft over the garage area. Ms. Carlisle showed her the area for clarification. The loft storage area is not connected to the house directly. Commissioner Swistak asked about the driveway, stone and gravel and the distinction of what is pervious and what is impervious. This stormwater design is generally for a single family home. If is it crushed gravel or stone it will be compacted and prevent stormwater getting through. There is a specification for crushed stone for a minimum of 4 inches. The proposed driveway will not change from being pervious to impervious. It is pervious pavers. As long as it is well maintained it should not become impervious. Enright asked is there any specific maintenance? Ms. Bryer asked if he has seen the motion for approval, she encourages him to add the maintenance of the pavers too. He agreed. This application includes the merger of the 2 lots and this will not be done until zoning approval is obtained and there should be a condition of approval that will go to the zoning board. This will be an administrative subdivision. Attorney Liberati reviewed the draft motion. There were a few minor changes made to the draft motion after Mr. Liberati\u2019s review. A discussion ensued regarding the motion with additions and changes. Mr. Liberati agreed to all the changes and agreed to the waiving of the reading of the motion.", "Planning Commission Minutes November 4, 2020 Page 5", "Commissioner Enright made a motion seconded by Commissioner Smith to recommend to the Jamestown Zoning Board of Review, approval of the application of Michael Langlois: AP 16, Lots 209-210; 85 Frigate Street, Jamestown, RI; being reviewed under Zoning Ordinance Section 314 - High Groundwater Table and Impervious Overlay District (HGWT) Sub-district A reviewed in accordance with the plan entitled Langlois Residence; Plat 16 Lots 209 & 210; Existing Conditions Plan, Proposed Site Plan, Schematic For Variance Discussion (2), Stormwater Data and Flow Paths, dated revised 5/1/2020; by Narragansett Engineering, Inc., 3102 East Main Road, Portsmouth, RI 02871, 401-683-6630.

Mr. DeSisto and Mr. Wirth explained the request for relief for the front yard and waterbody setbacks to build a single car garage at the front of the home. The house currently does not have a garage, although many houses in the neighborhood do have them. The applicant is requesting only a single car garage, and the proposed location is the only area on the property where it could fit based on the current house configuration. By placing the garage in the front yard, it will be as far away from the waterbody as possible. The application has gone before the Conservation Commission, which gave a recommendation for approval. The Board asked Mr. DeSisto for clarification on the certain dimensions. Mr. Rizzolo asked if other houses in the neighborhood have garages of similar format that are close to the road. Mr. Wirth responded that neighboring abutters have garages that are like what he is proposing. The Board had no further questions. No members from the public were present to speak in favor or opposition to the application.

Mrs. Chwalk has been at 7 Olive Lane for about 12 years and would like to enlarge the deck to make it more usable and to add privacy. Mrs. Chwalk noted that she has received neighborhood support for the proposed plan. Mr. Blasbalg asked the owner why she needed the increased depth and length, and why it has to be moved so close to the property line. The applicant\u2019s response to Mr. Blasbalg was inaudible. Mr. Blasbalg did not have any follow-up questions. Mr. Rizzolo asked for clarification on where the new stairs would be - if within the area of the new proposed deck or beyond; the owner clarified that the stairs would be beyond the deck as depicted on the drawings. The Board questioned whether that detail changed the entire application. Mr. Freel brought up concerns about the audio and not being able to hear the applicant clearly, and clarification about the steps and the amount of relief being requested because the stairs were not included in the drawing. He recommended that the applicant submit a drawing that shows the steps and the dimensions from the steps to the backyard property line. Mrs. Chwalk clarified that the stairs would not go closer to the property line than the deck as depicted on the drawings. Mrs. Chwalk showed the Board a quick sketch of the drawing of the steps to help with clarification, but the Board still had concerns regarding the stairs. Because of this, Mr. Skwirz suggested to continue the application. The Chair opened the meeting for public comments.

Present: Anthony DeSisto, attorney for applicant, and Josh Kline, lead developer on the", "project for Stonefield Engineering and Design Mr. Freel recused himself from the application. Mr. DeSisto explained the dimensional variances and special use permits requested for the Board and introduced Mr. Kline. Mr. DeSisto reminded the Board that the plan had been approved by both the Planning Board and the Technical Review Committee. Prior to beginning the presentation from the applicant, the Board and Mr. Skwirz determined that when deciding, they would separate each aspect of the request into a separate motion, meaning sign variance, special use, and dimensional variance would be determined independently. Mr. Kline outlined and explained the adaptive-reuse project Chase Bank is proposing, including improvements to the current building and parking, the explanation of the request and location for the drive-up ATM. Mr. Kraig asked what would be the negative to moving the ATM closer to the building, to which Mr. Kline noted how the proposed design allows adequate distance for traffic to move between the ATM and parking lot. Mr. Kline outlined the changes to be made to the building, which were minor, including adding ADA compliant features, lighting fixtures, and a fence to protect the abutting neighbor\u2019s hedge. Mr. Kraig questioned how the lighting would differ from the lighting with the prior usage of the property. Mr. Kline was not familiar with how the former tenant operated lighting but noted how the ATM would be open 24/7 and the safety and security standards that need to be upheld, and how lighting plays a role. Mr. Kline reviewed the signage proposals, with changes made based upon the Planning Board\u2019s", "suggestions to conform to the Town\u2019s standards. He explained the two flush-wall signs on the building for which the applicant sought relief, and stated that they were to scale with the existing", "Page 7 of 11", "building. Mr. Blasbalg asked for clarification on the rules for signs on a corner, and Mr. Kline referred him to \u00a7 185-97 of the Barrington Zoning Ordinance. Lastly, Mr. Kline summarized the traffic report conducted by the applicant. Mr. Blasbalg asked about the average peak queue for the ATM, and how that would impact the neighborhood traffic. Mr. Kline noted how ATM transaction time is relatively quick at approximately two minutes, allowing traffic and the queue to run smoothly, and it will run as a traditional ATM. The Board noted that some ATMs now have the capability of permitting communication with a teller and execution of additional transactions, and asked if Chase could upgrade or change the ATM at some future point. Mr. Skwirz noted that the Board could make such a limitation as a condition, but Chase Bank could return before the Board in the future if Chase ever wanted to make such changes. Mr. Meyer clarified with Mr. Kline that Chase would be the sole tenant of the building and there is no loading space for the bank usage. Mr. Kline noted that a loading space is not typically needed for a bank due to the nature of its business, and eliminating the space would allow for better traffic flow. Mr. Rizzolo clarified an administrative error on the agenda - the special-use permit for the loading space was not listed. Mr. Skwirz opined that because the section was noted in the listing, was included in the application, and was posted on the Town\u2019s website for public", "viewing, there was sufficient notice. The Chair opened the meeting for public comments. Mrs. Bruce, 31 Maple Avenue, an immediate abutter, asked to review the requirements for a special-use permit and dimensional variance. Mr. DeSisto and Mr. Skwirz explained the code sections and the standards for each of them, and how the Chase Bank application fits into those codes and requirements. Mrs. Bruce expressed her concern about the proximity of the drive-up ATM to her property line, including the traffic and 24/7 usage of the ATM. In addition, Mrs. Bruce expressed concerns about the proposed landscaping plan and how it would affect her hedges, and a need to complete a survey at 31 Maple Avenue.

Mrs. Bruce mentioned additional concerns regarding the hedges, including alleging misleading descriptions of the hedges and the proposed fence.

Additionally, the standards for a dimensional variance set forth in Section\u00a7185-71 have been met", "Page 10 of 11", "because the applicant has proved that the hardship to be suffered by the owner, absent granting the relief, would amount to more than a mere inconvenience \u2013 without the relief, the bank would have to move the drive-thru lane into the egress of the rest of the property. The Board resumed its discussion of the request for a special use permit for the drive-thru ATM. Mr. Blasbalg commented that he believes more work could be done to create a balance between the interests of the bank and of the neighbor. The Board noted that the proposed location is in a Commercial District, and drive-thru ATMs are standard at banks in the current environment. The Board discussed changes and adjustments that could be made to create a balance between the business and the neighboring abutter. MOTION: Mr. Meyer made a motion to grant the drive-thru special-use permit with the", "following conditions: \u2022 The fence, as depicted, and the hedges that, according to the survey, are", "overhanging the applicant\u2019s property, are maintained as is. \u2022 The ATM will be a standard ATM that does not have audio beyond assistance", "for patrons who are hard of hearing.", "Mr. Donahue seconded the motion. The motion failed, (3-2). Members aye nay Paul Blasbalg X Ian Donahue X Thomas Kraig X Ladd Meyer X David Rizzolo X REASON FOR VOTES TO APPROVE A SPECIAL USE PERMIT FOR AN ATM: It was the judgment of the majority of the Board that the standards in \u00a7 185-73 have been met: A) the public convenience and welfare will be substantially served\u2013 this is a Commercial District where banking is allowed, a drive-thru ATM is common, and it will serve the community at large; B) it will be in harmony with the general purpose of this chapter ,and with the Comprehensive Plan \u2013this is a Commercial District, with banking allowed, and a drive-thru ATM is common, almost necessary, for new banks; C) it will not result in or create conditions that will be inimical to the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the community \u2013 there is nothing to suggest a drive-thru ATM will impact any public health issues, the layout with the queue suggests they have considered public safety, and it will serve the community; D) it will not substantially or permanently injure the appropriate use of the property in the surrounding area or district \u2013 this lot is in a Commercial District, ATMs are common with other banks in the area. REASON FOR VOTES TO DENY A SPECIAL USE PERMIT FOR AN ATM: It was the judgment of Mr. Blasbalg and Mr. Rizzolo that the applicant failed to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7185-73 D), finding that the applicant has failed to prove that an ATM as proposed will not substantially or permanently injure the appropriate use of the property in the surrounding area or district.

This week Grades 2 and 3 came back and therefore the elementary schools is completely back in school.", "Principal Daigneault informs that all is well and running smoothly. The protocols and procedures that were followed at the beginning of the year has been tremendously helpful for a smooth return. Teachers and staff have stepped up and all systems are working efficiently. Mr. St. Jean spoke briefly about our 7 COVID positive cases. He feels we are following all the right protocols as there has not been any in-school spread. He did point out, however, that the RIDOH is not communicating as quickly as possible. This was very evidence in our last positive case.", "4. The next grade levels to return in full are Grade 6 and Grade 9. Grade 6 is scheduled to return the week of", "November 16th because of current quarantine of Middle School Administration, PE Department, and office staff. Grade 9 is tentatively scheduled to return the week of November 16th as well depending on scheduling. Grade 6 is a very large class; however, accommodations have been made to make this happen. Grade 9 is more problematic to bring back; however, Mr. McGee feels it is a transition year and the students need to", "come back. Principal McGee stated that there is a large majority that are just not engaging. He feels that Grade 9 falls in that category. He believes getting Grade 9 back is important and confirmed the difficulty with lunches and stable pods in school. There will be an unavoidable period of new exposures. He also pointed out the limited staffing which is becoming a problem. Because of the Middle School quarantining, administration and staff has been pulled from the high school to help at the Middle School. Despite the staffing issue, he continues to feel that Grade 9 is a priority. He informed everyone that a \u201ctown hall\u201d type of meeting will be held to get more feedback from parents and students. A schedule will be going out soon. Mr. St. Jean asked parents to please verify their contact information with the schools. He stressed the importance of doing so in order to communicate fully all of the important information day by day, if necessary. North Smithfield High School is not an academy style school and therefore stable pods are impossible. The best that Administration can do is move students around to keep class sizes down. The High School needs more time to make accommodations and scheduling changes. When Grade 9 is back, we will have to monitor it very closely for safety assurances. Mr. St. Jean stated that if he were to choose another grade level to return after Grade 9 that it would be Grade 12. However, this could not be even contemplated until after Thanksgiving or later. Mr. Connell asked how college planning is moving forward virtually. He also asked if the students are getting the help they need with college applications and financial aid. Mr. Pepin stated that through Google Classrooms, Google Meets, and emails he has had conversations regarding financial aid and applications with parents and students. He and the guidance office send out information to all seniors often and are very involved in the process. Mrs. O\u2019Brien stated that Mrs. Aromin has been doing an amazing job with the senior projects as well as helping the students with college essays. She feels that seniors know their support system and are being supported. She believes that Grade 9 would need to come back in person before the senior class.

Mrs. Arnold updated everyone on the critical standards as well as other standards that are still important", "but not a focus at this point. She went through the progress being made with students. She stated that teachers are giving the students multiple opportunities to get work done and have pushed deadlines out to accommodate the students as well. They are also looking into changing the amount of written assignments given and ramping up other instruction. She pointed out that the students have truly only been in school and received true instruction for 3 weeks and these transitions take time. She thanked teachers for their amazing efforts and for delivering rigorous, good instruction in a difficult situation.", "6. Public Discussion: Mr. Neri feels that continued attention on kids\u2019 mental health needs to be a priority. He would like to see a more emphasized effort on getting kids back in school than focusing on the 6-foot barrier. Mr. Halliwell asked/suggested whether a shortened day for Grades 7-12 could be a possibility for core classes", "and eliminating lunch altogether and having non-core classes virtually in the afternoon. Mr. St. Jean stated that all types of schedules have been discussed. One senior\u2019s parent confirmed that supports are there for the seniors. Response is very quick and very helpful. Mrs. O\u2019Brien wanted it acknowledged that there are full Distance Learning students that are thriving and doing very well. So, while we should be looking at the student\u2019s mental health, we should continue to proceed safely.

I know we have a review of this annually. We have the annual Superintendent\u2019s evaluation, we have multiple things that only occur once a year and I think to keep all that on track and tight for the Committee if we have them all converge on the same meeting date, if possible or structure it some way where we don\u2019t forget about this somewhere down the road. Ms. Dube commented just because I\u2019ve talked to other committees in the state about how they do this. Similar to how the policy subcommittee is what we do is after the legislative season is when we take a legislative review to see what we need to change in the policy manual. We do that in July every year or we have for the past three or four years. I talked with other school committees who work out with their Superintendent when the contract is running to say what is a good time for us to be doing this? Maybe it\u2019s October, maybe it\u2019s May. Budget season is a tough time. They just set a time and a month and that is the month they do the gathering of information and the evaluation. It happens the same time every year and people just get used to it.
